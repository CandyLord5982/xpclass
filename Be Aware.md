For everyday, moment to moment use let's just focus on the subject. Everything else that can be experienced is object. The subject is awareness myself. I am that which is aware.

Meditation is to notice the natural, effortless, awareness that you're essentially are and be that knowingly.

The awareness can be realized by softening focus on object and come back to yourself

The method is "Am I aware?" It could raise confusion but very effective.

The problem with I am is that I still identify with body or thoughts.



**Patch update: September 1st**



The goal is to know what I am.

Like everything else, you know something by giving it your attention.

Quan sát is just the medium to get to self.

The real path is to "be" yourself directly.

Be what you refer to when you say I am.

It already include all the benefits that QS brings only more intensely





***Outdated version***



*Quan sát in my experience is the only way to boost dignity which is crucial for stopping indulging and temptation.*

*Try including quan sát daily activities, everyone of them.*



*Don't be fooled by following other path after you gain confidence.*

*They might be more productive and efficient but they're not as intense.*

*You need intensity if you want to keep going.*

*Success first, spirituality later.*



*QS is the direct, instant path to a soothing and calming state of mind which make entertainment redundant.*



*Why it works better than other: even tho other methods might be more direct to yourself, they don't safeguard you from thoughts which are detrimental for overall well-being. This one take you way back to when you began. You feel good immediately, more organized just for the sake of it, perversion is now gone, you have way more control over everything.*



*Actually QS is just being aware of self but in less direct manner.*



*QS is my jam. NB is almost the same and passive mode of QS but it doesn't kill thoughts so it's only suitable after you're rooted in self.*
