Question 1 - de55ec71

Generations of mystery and horror ______ have been influenced by the dark, gothic stories of celebrated American author
Edgar Allan Poe (1809–1849).
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~=writers#Correct. Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation between a subject and a verb. When, as in this case,
a subject (“Generations of mystery and horror writers”) is immediately followed by a verb (“have been influenced”), no
punctuation is needed.~writers,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the subject and the verb.~writers—#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because no
punctuation is needed between the subject and the verb.~writers;#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between
the subject and the verb.}

Question 2 - 4b0c7b62

The algaita is a double reed wind instrument from West Africa. The reed of a wind instrument is the mouthpiece ______ A
double reed contains two pieces of cane that vibrate and produce sound as air passes between them.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~where sound is made?#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. It’s unconventional to use a question mark to punctuate a declarative sentence.~where is sound made.#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect.
The structure requires that the sentence continue as a declarative clause, not end with an interrogative clause. Choice D is
incorrect. The structure requires that the sentence continue as a declarative clause and end with a period, not end with an
interrogative clause and a question mark.~=where sound is made.#Correct. Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is end-of-sentence punctuation. This choice correctly uses a period
to punctuate a declarative sentence ("the reed of a wind instrument is the mouthpiece") that ends with a prepositional phrase
("where sound is made").~where is sound made?#No explanation provided.}

Question 3 - a7c85001

Researchers Amit Kumar and Nicholas Epley investigated how ______ In a series of experiments conducted in 2022, they
found that people performing small acts of kindness underestimated the positive effect their actions had on others.  
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~do people perceive acts of kindness.#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. The structure of the sentence requires a declarative clause at the end of the sentence that states what
Kumar and Epley did, not an interrogative clause that asks a direct question, such as "how do people perceive acts of
kindness."~do people perceive acts of kindness?#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. The structure of the sentence requires a declarative clause at the end of the sentence that
states what Kumar and Epley did, not an interrogative clause that asks a direct question, such as "how do people perceive
acts of kindness?"~people perceive acts of kindness?#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. It’s unconventional to use a question mark in this way to punctuate a declarative
sentence that asks an indirect question, such as "Researchers…kindness."~=people perceive acts of kindness.#Correct. Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is end-of-sentence punctuation. This choice correctly uses a
period to punctuate a declarative sentence that asks an indirect question ("Researchers Amit Kumar and Nicholas Epley
investigated how people perceive acts of kindness").}

Question 4 - 333b2b65

While one requires oxygen and one does ______ and anaerobic respiration are both forms of cellular respiration—that is, they
are processes by which cells break down glucose to use as energy.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~not aerobic#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a run-on sentence error. “While...not” is a dependent clause, which must be
separated from the independent clause that follows with some sort of punctuation.~not. Aerobic#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. This choice
creates a sentence fragment. “While one requires oxygen and one does not” isn’t an independent clause, so it can’t stand
alone as a complete sentence.~=not, aerobic#Correct. Choice C is the best answer. A comma is the appropriate way to link the dependent clause “While...not” and the independent
clause that follows.~not; aerobic#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error. “While one requires oxygen and
one does not” isn’t an independent clause, so it can’t be linked to the clause that follows with a semicolon.}

Question 5 - 148be4da

Human-made (synthetic) fibers used in clothes and many other consumer products are more durable than most natural plant
______ the manufacture of synthetic fibers requires toxic chemical solvents that can pollute air and water.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~fibers,#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can’t be used in this
way to join two main clauses.~fibers but#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because when coordinating two longer main clauses such as these, it’s
conventional to use a comma before the coordinating conjunction.~fibers#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a run-on
sentence. The two main clauses are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.~=fibers, but#Correct. Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is the coordination of main clauses within a sentence. This choice
correctly uses a comma and the coordinating conjunction “but” to join the first main clause (“Human-made...fibers”) and the
second main clause (“the manufacture...water”).}

Question 6 - 155239cf

By analyzing ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica, a research team at Sweden’s Lund University discovered evidence of a
solar storm that occurred 9,200 years ago. Scientists had previously thought the Sun to be in a relatively “quiet” phase at that
______ the Lund team’s finding suggests otherwise.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~time but#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because when coordinating two longer main clauses such as these, it’s conventional to use a comma
before the coordinating conjunction.~=time, but#Correct. Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is the coordination of main clauses within a sentence. This choice
correctly uses a comma and the coordinating conjunction "but" to join the first main clause ("Scientists...time") and the
second main clause ("the Lund...otherwise").~time,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction
following it, a comma can’t be used in this way to join two main clauses.~time#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a run-on
sentence. The two main clauses are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.}

Question 7 - 9091458d

Emperor penguins don’t waddle out of the ocean. They launch themselves at such a high speed that they travel up to two
meters before landing. How ______ A layer of microbubbles on their plumage reduces friction as the penguins speed to the
surface.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~they are able to move so fast!#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because the context requires an interrogative sentence. The exclamative sentence “how they are able
to move so fast!” emphasizes the penguin’s high rate of speed, but it doesn’t set up the next sentence’s explanation of how
the penguins achieve such speeds.~are they able to move so fast.#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because a period can’t be used in this way to punctuate an
interrogative sentence.~they are able to move so fast.#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because the context requires an interrogative sentence. The exclamative
sentence “how they are able to move so fast” emphasizes the penguin’s high rate of speed, but it doesn’t set up the next
sentence’s explanation of how the penguins achieve such speeds.~=are they able to move so fast?#Correct. Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is end-of-sentence punctuation. This choice correctly uses a
question mark to punctuate the interrogative sentence “how are they able to move so fast?” The interrogative sentence asks
a direct question, and the next sentence answers it.}

Question 8 - b0115ef6

Technologies such as microphones and inkjet printers are made using piezoelectric materials, which generate an internal
electric field when pressure is applied to them. The toxic nature of some of these materials recently led a team from the
University of Sheffield to investigate how ______
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~could their use be better regulated?#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because the structure requires a period and a declarative clause at the end of the sentence that states
what the team investigated, not an interrogative clause that asks a direct question, such as "how could their use be better
regulated?"~=their use could be better regulated.#Correct. Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is end-of-sentence punctuation. This choice correctly uses a period
to punctuate a declarative sentence that asks an indirect question ("The toxic nature of some of these materials recently led
a team from the University of Sheffield to investigate how their use could be better regulated").~their use could be better regulated?#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because it’s unconventional to use a question mark in this way to punctuate a declarative
sentence.~could their use be better regulated.#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because the structure requires a declarative clause at the end of the sentence that states
what the team investigated, not an interrogative clause that asks a direct question, such as "how could their use be better
regulated?"}

Question 9 - 6fece68e

Emperor Ashoka ruled the Maurya Empire in South Asia from roughly 270 to 232 BCE. He is known for enforcing a moral
code called the Law of Piety, which established the sanctity of animal ______ the just treatment of the elderly, and the
abolition of the slave trade.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~life#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error. Notice that "the sanctity of animal life" is the first item in a list
of three things. To appropriately format the list, we need punctuation to separate each item.~life;#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. This
choice creates a punctuation error. Notice that "the sanctity of animal life" is the first item in a list of three things. While
semicolons are sometimes used to separate list items, this list uses commas to separate the other list items, and lists must
use the same punctuation throughout.~life:#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error. Notice that "the
sanctity of animal life" is the first item in a list of three things. While colons can be used to introduce lists, they can’t be used
to separate items within a list.~=life,#Correct. Choice D is the best answer. Notice that "the sanctity of animal life" is the first item in a list of three things. We must use a
comma to separate the first two items in the list, just as a comma is used to separate "the just treatment of the elderly" and
"the abolition of the slave trade."}

Question 10 - 1724dac2

A subseasonal weather forecast attempts to predict weather conditions three to four weeks in ______ its predictions are
therefore more short-term than those of the seasonal forecast, which attempts to predict the weather more than a month in
advance.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~advance,#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a run-on sentence error. The clause “A subseasonal…advance” and the clause “its
predictions…forecast” are both independent clauses, so a comma is not enough to separate them.~advance#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. This
choice creates a run-on sentence error. The clause “A subseasonal…advance” and the clause “its predictions…forecast” are
both independent clauses, so they need to be separated with specific punctuation (a period, a semi-colon, a colon, a dash, or
a comma + a coordinating conjunction).~=advance;#Correct. Choice C is the best answer. The clause “A subseasonal…advance” and the clause “its predictions…forecast” are both
independent clauses, so using a semicolon to separate them is grammatically correct.~advance and#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect. This choice creates a run-on sentence error. The clause “A
subseasonal…advance” and the clause “its predictions…forecast” are both independent clauses, so the word “and” by itself is
not enough to separate them. There would need to be a comma before “and” for this choice to work.}

Question 11 - a1e0c981

In her book The Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts, author Maxine Hong Kingston examines themes
______ childhood, womanhood, and Chinese American identity by intertwining autobiography and mythology.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~of:#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. This choice inappropriately breaks up the introduction of a list. Also, “In her book…themes of” is not an
independent clause, thanks to the dangling “of” at the end, so it can’t precede a colon.~=of#Correct. Choice B is the best answer. “Themes of childhood” is one noun phrase, with “themes of” implicitly carrying over to the other
items on the list (“themes of childhood, [themes of] womanhood, and [themes of] Chinese American identity”).~of—#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. This choice
inappropriately breaks up the introduction of a list. Also, “In her book…themes of” is not an independent clause, thanks to the
dangling “of” at the end, so it can’t precede a single dash.~of,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect. This choice inappropriately breaks up the
introduction of a list. “Themes of” implicitly carries over to each item on the list (“themes of childhood, [themes of]
womanhood, and [themes of] Chinese American identity”), so we don’t want to use a comma to separate it.}

Question 12 - b35cefb7

The fine, powdery substance that covers the Moon’s surface is called regolith. Because regolith is both readily available and
high in oxygen ______ scientists have wondered whether it could be used as a potential source of oxygen for future lunar
settlements.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~content and#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. Joining the subordinate clause (“Because...content”) and the clause that follows
(“scientists...settlements”) with the conjunction “and” results in an ungrammatical sentence that lacks a main clause. Choice
C is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the subordinate clause and the main clause with appropriate
punctuation.~=content,#Correct. Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation between a subordinate clause and a main clause.
This choice correctly uses a comma to mark the boundary between the subordinate clause (“Because...content”) and the
main clause (“scientists...settlements”).~content#No explanation provided.~content, and#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect. Joining the subordinate clause (“Because...content”) and the clause that follows
(“scientists...settlements”) with a comma and the conjunction “and” results in an ungrammatical sentence that lacks a main
clause.}

Question 13 - 486f03da

The short story “Rogue Enchantments” by Isabel Ibañez appears in Reclaim the ______ anthology of fantasy and science
fiction written by authors of Latin American descent.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~Stars. An#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because it results in a rhetorically unacceptable sentence fragment beginning with "an anthology."~Stars, while an#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. Joining the main clause and the following supplementary element with the conjunction "while" results
in a confusing and ungrammatical sentence.~Stars an#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the main
clause and the supplementary element with appropriate punctuation.~=Stars, an#Correct. Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of punctuation within a sentence. This choice correctly
uses a comma to mark the boundary between the main clause ("The short...Stars") and the supplementary element ("an
anthology...descent") that provides additional information about what Reclaim the Stars is.}

Question 14 - aab78b25

Psychophysicist Howard Moskowitz was hired by a soda company to determine how much artificial sweetener ______ After
conducting consumer taste tests, he found that no such ideal existed: participants expressed a wide range of preferences
for different blends of sweetener, carbonization, and flavoring.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~do most people prefer in a diet drink?#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. This doesn’t complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. This
sentence is not a question—it’s a statement. So a question mark is not the appropriate punctuation.~do most people prefer in a diet drink.#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect.
This doesn’t complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. We already have the verbs
“was hired…to determine” in this sentence. The verb “do” is not needed and results in a confusing, ungrammatical
sentence.~most people prefer in a diet drink?#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. This doesn’t complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard
English. This sentence is not a question—it’s a statement. So a question mark is not the appropriate punctuation.~=most people prefer in a diet drink.#Correct. Choice D is the best answer. This sentence is a statement: “Moskowitz was hired by a soda company to determine how
much artificial sweetener most people prefer in a diet drink.” So a period is the most appropriate punctuation mark.}

Question 15 - 8b002b08

Many Samoans enjoy a sport called kilikiti. This bat-and-ball game was derived from ______ kilikiti differs from cricket in a
few key ways.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~cricket but:#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. When coordinating two main clauses such as these, it’s not conventional to use a colon in this way
after the coordinating conjunction.~cricket but,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. When coordinating two main clauses such as these, it’s not
conventional to use a comma in this way after the coordinating conjunction.~=cricket, but#Correct. Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the coordination of main clauses within a sentence. This choice
correctly uses a comma before the coordinating conjunction "but" to join the first main clause ("This bat-and-ball game was
derived from cricket") and the second main clause ("kilikiti differs from cricket in a few key ways").~cricket, but,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect. When coordinating two
main clauses such as these, it’s not conventional to use a comma in this way after the coordinating conjunction.}

Question 16 - 70ced8dc

Typically, underlines, scribbles, and notes left in the margins by a former owner lower a book’s ______ when the former owner
is a famous poet like Walt Whitman, such markings, known as marginalia, can be a gold mine to literary scholars.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~=value, but#Correct. Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the coordination of independent clauses within a sentence. An
independent clause is a phrase containing a subject and a verb that can stand on its own as a sentence. This choice uses a
comma and the coordinating conjunction “but” to join the first independent clause (“underlines…lower a book’s value”) and
the second independent clause (“such markings…can be a gold mine to scholars”) to create a compound sentence.~value#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two independent clauses are fused without punctuation
and/or a conjunction.~value,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can’t be used in this way to mark
the boundary between two independent clauses.~value but#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because a comma is needed to mark the boundary
between two coordinated independent clauses.}

Question 17 - 8a3998f1

After the United Kingdom began rolling out taxes equivalent to a few cents on single-use plastic grocery bags in 2011,
plastic-bag consumption decreased by up to ninety ______ taxes are subject to what economists call the “rebound effect”: as
the change became normalized, plastic-bag use started to creep back up.

{1:MCV:~percent, such#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can’t be used in this way to mark the boundary
between sentences.~percent and such#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. Without a comma preceding it, the conjunction “and” can’t be used in this way to
join sentences.~=percent. Such#Correct. Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period
after “percent” is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence (“After…percent”) and another (“Such…up”).~percent such#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The sentences (“After…percent” and “Such…up”)
are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.}

Question 18 - 96953201

In her two major series “Memory Test” and “Autobiography,” painter Howardena Pindell explored themes ______ healing, selfdiscovery, and memory by cutting and sewing back together pieces of canvas and inserting personal artifacts, such as
postcards, into some of the paintings.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~=of#Correct. Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation between a preposition and its complement. No
punctuation is needed between the preposition “of” and its complement, the noun phrase “healing, self-discovery, and
memory.”~of,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between a preposition and its complement.~of—#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect
because no punctuation is needed between a preposition and its complement.~of:#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because no punctuation
is needed between a preposition and its complement.}

identified as being from the Moon or Mars.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~asteroids. Several#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. This choice results in a sentence fragment. "Although…asteroids" is a dependent clause. It can’t stand
on its own as a sentence, which means it can’t end in a period.~=asteroids, several#Correct. Choice B is the best answer. This choice uses a comma to correctly separate the dependent clause "although…asteroids"
from the independent clause "several hundred have been…Mars."~asteroids; several#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. This choice results in a punctuation
error. "Although…asteroids" is a dependent clause and can’t be joined to the independent clause "several hundred have been…
Mars" with a semicolon. A semicolon can only join two independent clauses.~asteroids: several#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect. This choice creates a
punctuation error. A colon can only come after an independent clause, but "although…asteroids" is a dependent clause.}

Question 20 - 60713427

Polyphenols are organic compounds ______ among their many roles, provide pigment that helps protect plants against
ultraviolet radiation from sunlight.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~that—#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because a dash can’t be paired with a comma to separate the supplementary element from the rest of
the sentence.~that;#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because a semicolon can’t be paired with a comma to separate the supplementary
element from the rest of the sentence.~=that,#Correct. Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the punctuation of a supplementary element within a sentence.
The comma after “that” pairs with the comma after “roles” to separate the supplementary element “among their many roles”
from the rest of the sentence. This supplementary element functions to clarify that polyphenols have many roles, and the
pair of commas indicates that this element could be removed without affecting the grammatical coherence of the sentence.~that:#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because a colon can’t be paired with a comma to separate the
supplementary element from the rest of the sentence.}

Question 21 - 89ab0d46

After the printing press was introduced in 1440, handwritten manuscripts from Europe’s medieval period were often
destroyed and the paper used for other purposes. In one instance, pages ______ a collection of Norse tales dating to 1270
were discovered lining a bishop’s miter (hat).
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~from:#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. This choice results in a punctuation error, illogically separating the preposition “from” from the rest of
the prepositional phrase with a colon. Also, a colon can only follow an independent clause, but what comes before the blank
could not stand on its own as a complete sentence.~from,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. This choice results in a punctuation error,
illogically separating the preposition “from” from the rest of the prepositional phrase with a comma.~=from#Correct. Choice C is the best answer. The word “from” introduces a prepositional phrase that modifies the noun “pages” and provides
essential information about their origin. No additional punctuation is needed after “from” in this context.~from—#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect.
This choice results in a punctuation error, illogically separating the preposition “from” from the rest of the prepositional
phrase with a dash.}

conjunction.~century,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can’t be
used in this way to join two main clauses.~=century, but#Correct. Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the coordination of main clauses within a sentence. This choice
correctly uses a comma and a coordinating conjunction ("but") to join the first main clause ("Leibniz...century") and the
second main clause ("these ingenious...calculators").~century that#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because joining the two main clauses in this way with the
subordinating conjunction "that" results in an ungrammatical and illogical sentence.}

The life spans of rockfish vary greatly by species. For instance, the colorful calico rockfish (Sebastes dallii) can survive for a
little over a ______ the rougheye rockfish (Sebastes aleutianus) boasts a maximum life span of about two centuries. 
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~decade: while#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because a colon can’t be used in this way to join a main clause and a subordinate clause. Choice B is
incorrect because it results in a rhetorically unacceptable sentence fragment beginning with "while."~decade. While#No explanation provided.~decade; while#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect
because a semicolon can’t be used in this way to join a main clause and a subordinate clause.~=decade, while#Correct. Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation between a main clause and a subordinate clause.
This choice correctly uses a comma to mark the boundary between the main clause ("the colorful…decade") and the
subordinate clause ("while…centuries") that provides contrasting information about the life span of rougheye rockfish.}

Question 24 - 04bfd364

The intense pressure found in the deep ocean can affect the structure of proteins in fish’s cells, distorting the proteins’
shape. The chemical trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) counters this effect, ensuring that proteins retain their original ______ is
found in high concentrations in the cells of the deepest-dwelling fish.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~=configurations. TMAO#Correct. Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period
after “configurations” is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence (“The intense…configurations”) and
another (“TMAO…fish”). The supplementary phrase (“ensuring…configurations”) modifies the main clause of the first
sentence (“The chemical…effect”), and “TMAO” is the subject of the second sentence.~configurations TMAO#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The sentences  (“The intense…configurations” and “TMAO…
fish”) are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.~configurations, TMAO#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A
comma can’t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences.~configurations and TMAO#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect. Without a comma
preceding it, the conjunction “and” can’t be used in this way to join sentences.}

Question 25 - ea8f4658

When particles are suspended in liquid (like pollen in a water glass), they will zigzag randomly through the liquid and collide
with one another in perpetuity. This type of random, continuous ______ is known as Brownian motion, can be observed
throughout the natural world.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~movement: which#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. This choice results in a punctuation error. The relative clause "which is known as Brownian motion" is a
nonessential supplement. Nonessential supplements need to be set apart from the rest of the sentence with a pair of
commas, dashes, or parentheses, so we can’t use a colon here. Also, notice that colons can only come after an independent
clause, which isn’t the case here.~=movement, which#Correct. Choice B is the best answer. This choice correctly uses commas to set off the nonessential relative clause "which is known
as Brownian motion" that provides extra information about the "random, continuous movement" that isn’t necessary for the
function of the sentence.~movement which#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. This choice results in a punctuation error. The relative clause "which
is known as Brownian motion" is a nonessential supplement, so it should be separated from the rest of the sentence by a
pair of matching punctuation marks. We already have a comma after "motion," so we need to add a comma before "which."
This choice is missing that comma.~movement. Which#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect. This choice results in a sentence fragment. "This type of random,
continuous movement" is not an independent clause and can’t stand alone as a full sentence, so we can’t put a period here.}

Question 26 - c21df211

In 1959, the film industry debuted Smell-O-Vision. Theaters were fitted with specialized vents that emitted odors at specific
points in a ______ as the scent of roses when roses appeared in a scene. Smell-O-Vision failed to impress, however, with one
reviewer declaring it “briefly weird and not very interesting.”
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~movie such#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. This choice results in a run-on sentence. Since the example of roses isn’t necessary for the sentence
to function, the descriptive aside "such as…scene" needs to be separated from the preceding independent clause with some
sort of punctuation.~movie; such#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error. A semicolon can only be used to separate
two independent clauses, but "such…scene" is not an independent clause and couldn’t stand on its own as a sentence.~movie. Such#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. This choice results in a sentence fragment. The descriptive aside "Such…scene" is not an independent
clause and can’t stand on its own as a sentence.~=movie, such#Correct. Choice D is the best answer. The comma appropriately separates the nonessential descriptive aside "such as…scene" from
the independent clause "Theaters were…movie." Since the descriptive example of roses isn’t necessary for the sentence to
function, it needs to be set off with punctuation.}

______ stations, and public squares.  
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~libraries train#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because it fails to separate the first two items ("libraries" and "train stations") in the series. Choice B is
incorrect because a colon can’t be used in this way to separate items in a simple series.~libraries: train#No explanation provided.~libraries—train#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because a
dash can’t be used in this way to separate items in a simple series.~=libraries, train#Correct. Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is the punctuation of items in a simple series. The comma after
"libraries" is used conventionally to separate the first and second items ("libraries" and "train stations") in the series.}

and the clause after the blank ("she…professionals") are independent clauses, so they need to be separated by punctuation.~settings, she#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. This choice results in a comma splice error. It incorrectly joins two independent clauses with just a
comma. Linking two independent clauses with a comma also requires the use of a coordinating conjunction (like for, and,
nor, but, or, yet, or so).~settings and she#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. This choice results in a run-on sentence, an error caused when two independent
clauses are joined without punctuation or appropriate conjunctions. Since both the clause before the blank ("In 2000…
settings") and the clause after the blank ("she…professionals") are independent, a comma would be required in addition to
the coordinating conjunction "and."~=settings. She#Correct. Choice D is the best answer. It appropriately uses a period to mark the end of one independent clause ("In 2000…settings")
and the start of another ("She founded…professionals").}

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

{1:MCV:~=Act, which#Correct. Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of punctuation between a main clause and a
supplementary element. In this choice, the comma is used correctly to mark the boundary between the main clause
("This...Act") and the supplementary relative clause ("which...designs") that provides additional information about the
Engravers’ Copyright Act.~Act; which#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because a semicolon can’t be used in this way to mark the boundary between a main clause and a
