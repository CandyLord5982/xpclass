MOODLE CLOZE FORMAT OUTPUT:
==================================================
Question 1 - c966ad55

The following text is from Srimati Svarna Kumari Devi’s 1894 novel The Fatal Garland (translated by A. Christina Albers in
1910). Shakti is walking near a riverbank that she visited frequently during her childhood.
She crossed the woods she knew so well. The trees seemed to extend their branches like welcoming arms. They
greeted her as an old friend. Soon she reached the river-side.
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?

{1:MCV:~It suggests that Shakti feels uncomfortable near the river.#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because the text and underlined portion suggest that Shakti is comfortable, not uncomfortable, in her
surroundings: the trees around her are described as welcoming and reassuring. Moreover, the underlined portion discusses
Shakti’s feelings in the forest, not the river, since she hasn’t reached the river yet.~It indicates that Shakti has lost her sense of direction in the woods.#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because the text and
underlined portion emphasize Shakti’s familiarity with the woods. The trees are inviting, and she feels like “an old friend” to
the woods, so she isn’t lost or confused there.~=It emphasizes Shakti’s sense of belonging in the landscape.#Correct. Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a
whole. The first sentence of the text states that Shakti knows the woods she is walking in well. The next sentence, which is
underlined, emphasizes Shakti’s familiarity with, and sense of security within, the woods by describing how the tree branches
are friendly and “welcoming,” as they are depicted as extending open arms to her. The remainder of the text also shows that
Shakti is comfortable and content in the woods by describing her as “an old friend” of the trees. Thus, the function of the
underlined portion is to emphasize Shakti’s sense of belonging in the wooded landscape that she visits.~It conveys Shakti’s appreciation for her long-term friendships.#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because the third sentence uses the phrase “as an old
friend” figuratively in reference to Shakti’s sense of familiarity with the landscape, not in reference to her long-standing
friendships with other people, and the text and underlined portion never discuss her feelings about such friendships.}

Question 2 - eaea6f8f

Ordinary soap bubbles usually exist for a minute or less before popping due to either a rupture forced by gravity-induced
drainage or the evaporation of the liquid from which the bubble is composed. But physicist Aymeric Roux and colleagues
discovered ways to mitigate these factors, resulting in bubbles that can last for a year or more. For example, glycerol tends
to adhere to water molecules, so a bubble with a shell that contains both water and glycerol is able to draw additional water
molecules from the surrounding air and thereby compensate for evaporation.
Which choice best states the purpose of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?

{1:MCV:~=It describes the effects of a process devised by researchers that increases the longevity of an object discussed in the#Correct. Choice A is the best answer because it describes how the underlined portion of the sentence functions in the text as a
whole. The text begins by discussing ordinary soap bubbles, objects that usually exist for less than a minute before popping
due to either evaporation or gravity-induced drainage. The text then goes on to mention work by researchers Aymeric Roux
and colleagues, who have discovered how to increase the longevity of bubbles by altering their chemical composition.
Finally, the underlined portion of the text describes how this process works: since the bubble contains both water and
glycerol, it can draw water molecules from the surrounding air to replace those lost to evaporation. Therefore, the underlined
portion of the sentence describes the effects of a process devised by researchers that increases the longevity of an object
described in the text.~It details the circumstances that prompted the research discussed in the text.#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because the circumstance that prompted the research is discussed in the first sentence of the text, not
the underlined portion.~It presents a reason why the phenomenon discussed in the text that the researchers wanted to avoid will inevitably occur.#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion of the text does not address why soap bubbles
must eventually rupture. Rather, it explains how the longevity of soap bubbles can be extended.~It mentions a method discussed in the text that researchers intend to test in future experiments.#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect
because the underlined portion of the text does not mention any future experiments.}

Question 3 - 066a3295

Researchers have found a nearly 164,000-year-old molar from a member of the archaic human species known as
Denisovans in a cave in Laos, suggesting that Denisovans lived in a wider range of environments than indicated by earlier
evidence. Before the discovery, Denisovans were thought to have lived only at high altitudes in relatively cold climates in
what are now Russia and China, but the discovery of the tooth in Laos suggests that they may have lived at low altitudes in
relatively warm climates in Southeast Asia as well.
Which choice best states the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?

{1:MCV:~It dismisses as untrue the research presented in the previous sentence.#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. The underlined portion doesn’t do this. Instead, it explains what we used to believe about Denisovans
before the discovery—it doesn’t dismiss the new discovery as false.~It defines a term used in the description that follows in the rest of the sentence.#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. The underlined portion doesn’t do
this. No term is defined here.~It emphasizes the main goal of the research introduced in the previous sentence.#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. The underlined portion doesn’t do this. The text never tells us what the
“goal” of the research was, just what its discovery was.~=It provides context that clarifies the significance of the information that follows in the rest of the sentence.#Correct. Choice D is the best answer. The text describes how a new discovery expands our understanding of Denisovans. The
underlined portion describes what we used to believe about Denisovans, which helps the reader understand the significance
of the discovery of the molar: it suggests that they lived in more places than we’d previously thought.}

Question 4 - 805e361d

Companies are providing consumers with more opportunities to purchase customized products than ever before. Whether
buying customized sneakers, jewelry, or clothing, consumers can participate in the design of products to meet their specific
needs and tastes. In turn, companies profit too: studies have shown that consumers are willing to pay more and wait longer
for a customized product. Still, it can be difficult for companies to offer customization while keeping costs low, as the
standard methods of mass production may not be able to accommodate making a unique product each time.
Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?

{1:MCV:~It discusses several recent innovations in product manufacturing and then suggests some potential applications of those#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t present the customization of various products as a recent innovation—the fact
that there are "more opportunities" now indicates that there were opportunities before—and no other innovations, in product
manufacturing or otherwise, are discussed.~It describes a company’s recent success with new products and then explains multiple factors that may have contributed#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss any particular company or
example and instead speaks broadly about the trend of companies providing customizable products.~=It introduces a trend in consumer products and then explains how the trend both benefits and poses a challenge to#Correct. Choice C is the best answer because it presents the best description of the overall structure of the text. The text begins by
stating that companies are increasingly giving consumers opportunities to customize products, allowing them to make
design choices when buying certain sneakers, jewelry, and clothing. The text then indicates that although this trend benefits
companies because they can successfully charge buyers more for customized products and don’t have to rush production, it
also poses a challenge because producing unique items may require different and more expensive methods than the ones
typically used for mass production, raising the companies’ costs. Thus, the text first introduces a trend in consumer products
and then explains how the trend both benefits and poses a challenge to companies.~It presents two contrasting product-marketing techniques and then provides examples of one of those techniques.#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect.
Although the text discusses companies offering something that consumers like and are willing to pay more for—the ability to
customize products—it doesn’t characterize this as a product-marketing technique and doesn’t compare it to any other kind
of offering or technique.}

Question 5 - e13171c4

Historians Tiya Miles and Roy E. Finkenbine have both documented the assistance Indigenous peoples gave to Black
freedom seekers leaving the South before the US Civil War. Much of the historical evidence of this help comes from
Indigenous oral traditions and from autobiographies written by the freedom seekers. One such narrative is Jermain Loguen’s
autobiography, which tells about how Neshnabé (Potawatomi) villagers offered him food, lodging, and directions during his
1835 journey from Tennessee to Canada.
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence?

{1:MCV:~=It provides an example of an autobiography that describes help given by an Indigenous people to a Black freedom seeker.#Correct. Choice A is the best answer. The previous sentence broadly mentions "autobiographies written by the freedom seekers." This
sentence identifies Loguen’s autobiography as a specific example.~It shows why Loguen decided to write in great detail about his experiences traveling from Tennessee to Canada in his#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence never explains why Loguen chose to write about his experiences.~It argues that autobiographies are particularly important sources of information about geography in the United States#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect.
The previous sentence identifies autobiographies as useful sources of historical information about a specific topic, but not
for "information about geography." The underlined sentence provides details of one autobiography as an example of a source
of information about that specific topic (interactions between Indigenous people and Black freedom seekers). Choice D is
incorrect. The text never discusses other specific people who helped freedom seekers, and therefore can’t make a
comparison between the Neshnabé and anyone else.~It suggests that most historians believe that Neshnabé villagers were more successful in assisting freedom seekers than#No explanation provided.}

Question 6 - 9421ed62

In 2007, computer scientist Luis von Ahn was working on converting printed books into a digital format. He found that some
words were distorted enough that digital scanners couldn’t recognize them, but most humans could easily read them. Based
on that finding, von Ahn invented a simple security test to keep automated “bots” out of websites. The first version of the
reCAPTCHA test asked users to type one known word and one of the many words scanners couldn’t recognize. Correct
answers proved the users were humans and added data to the book-digitizing project.
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

{1:MCV:~=To discuss von Ahn’s invention of reCAPTCHA#Correct. Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main purpose of the text. After providing a brief
introduction to computer scientist Luis von Ahn, the text focuses on discussing how von Ahn’s digitization work led to the
invention of a digital security test known as reCAPTCHA.~To explain how digital scanners work#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t address how digital scanners work.~To call attention to von Ahn’s book-digitizing project#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text
mentions von Ahn’s book-digitizing project, that information is provided as a detail, not as the main purpose of the text.~To indicate how popular reCAPTCHA is#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t provide any indication of reCAPTCHA’s popularity; instead, it describes
reCAPTCHA’s origin.}

Question 7 - c502943e

The following text is adapted from Cynthia Kadohata’s 2004 novel Kira-Kira.
[Uncle Katsuhisa] was as loud as my father was quiet. Even when he wasn’t talking, he made a lot of noise, clearing his
throat and sniffing and tapping his fingers.
©2004 by Cynthia Kadohata
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence?

{1:MCV:~It lists the kinds of topics Uncle Katsuhisa enjoys discussing.#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate what kinds of topics Uncle Katsuhisa enjoys discussing, only that he
is loud even when he isn’t speaking.~It suggests that Uncle Katsuhisa dislikes meeting new people.#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because the text never indicates how Uncle Katsuhisa feels about
meeting new people, only how loud he is.~=It contrasts Uncle Katsuhisa with the narrator’s father.#Correct. Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a
whole. The underlined sentence establishes a difference between Uncle Katsuhisa and the narrator’s father by describing
Uncle Katsuhisa as "loud" and the narrator’s father as "quiet." The text then elaborates on that contrast, describing some
ways Uncle Katsuhisa is very noisy even when he isn’t speaking.~It describes a conversation between the narrator and the narrator’s father.#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because the text never describes a conversation occurring
between any people; it refers to talking only when stating that Uncle Katsuhisa is loud even when he isn’t speaking.}

Question 8 - fb8b56bc

The following text is adapted from George Bernard Shaw’s 1912 play Pygmalion. Henry Higgins has just arrived at the house
of his mother (Mrs. Higgins). She is expecting her friends to visit soon.
MRS. HIGGINS: I’m serious, Henry. You offend all my friends: they stop coming whenever they meet you.
HIGGINS: Nonsense! I know I have no small talk; but people don’t mind.
MRS. HIGGINS: Oh! don’t they? Small talk indeed! What about your large talk? Really, dear, you mustn’t stay.
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

{1:MCV:~To describe what Henry’s mother does when she goes out with her friends#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate what Henry’s mother does when she’s out with her friends. Instead, it
focuses on what goes on when Henry and her friends visit her at the same time, indicating that since her friends find Henry’s
company disagreeable, she wishes him to leave before they arrive.~=To show that Henry’s mother wants him to leave#Correct. Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately states the main purpose of the text, which is to show that Henry’s
mother, Mrs. Higgins, wants Henry to leave her house. In the text, Mrs. Higgins complains that Henry offends all her friends
and that they stop coming when he’s also visiting. She then tells him directly, "you mustn’t stay." The overall exchange
conveys Mrs. Higgins’s intention for Henry to leave so as not to drive away her friends with his behavior.~To present a detailed account of what Henry’s home looks like#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t contain an
account of what Henry’s home looks like. The setting is established as the house of Henry’s mother, and the dialogue
focuses solely on her wish that Henry should depart before her friends arrive.~To explain why Henry often visits his mother#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t
mention how often Henry visits his mother nor does it provide any explanation for why he visits his mother. Instead, it
indicates that she thinks her friends dislike Henry and that she therefore wants him to depart before they arrive.}

Question 9 - e929fe98

Composer Florence Price won first place for her score Symphony in E Minor at the 1932 Wanamaker Foundation Awards.
The piece was performed the following year by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, a significant recognition of its quality.
Price continued to compose many musical pieces throughout her career, blending traditional Black spirituals with classical
European Romantic musical traditions. In recent years, Price’s concertos and symphonies have been performed and
recorded by several major orchestras, further preserving her work for others to enjoy.
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

{1:MCV:~=To provide examples of Price’s importance as a composer#Correct. Choice A is the best answer. The text provides an overview of Florence Price’s importance by describing her success at the
1932 Wanamaker Foundation Awards, her blending of Black spirituals and classical European Romantic musical traditions,
and the recent performances and recordings of her concertos and symphonies by major orchestras.~To argue that more major orchestras should perform Price’s compositions#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. The text does mention that Price’s compositions have been performed and recorded by major
orchestras, but it doesn’t argue that more orchestras should do so.~To describe the musical styles that inspired many of Price’s symphonies#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. The text does mention the blending
of Black spirituals and classical European Romantic musical traditions, but only briefly, as part of a broader overview of
Price’s career.~To compare Price’s scores with those of classical European composers#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect. The text mentions Price’s blending of Black spirituals with classical European Romantic
musical traditions, but it doesn’t directly compare Price’s scores with those of classical European composers.}

Question 10 - 2aaee77f

Some bird species don’t raise their own chicks. Instead, adult females lay their eggs in other nests, next to another bird
species’ own eggs. Female cuckoos have been seen quickly laying eggs in the nests of other bird species when those birds
are out looking for food. After the eggs hatch, the noncuckoo parents will typically raise the cuckoo chicks as if they were
their own offspring, even if the cuckoos look very different from the other chicks.
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?

{1:MCV:~It introduces a physical feature of female cuckoos that is described later in the text.#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. Rather than mentioning a physical feature of female cuckoos, the underlined sentence introduces a
specific behavior of female cuckoos: laying eggs in the nests of birds of other species when the other birds are away. The
only reference to physical features is the last sentence’s general mention of cuckoo chicks looking different from chicks of
other species.~It describes the appearance of the cuckoo nests mentioned earlier in the text.#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence refers to the nests of birds other than cuckoos and
doesn’t describe how any nests look, cuckoo or otherwise. Instead, the sentence addresses how female cuckoos use other
birds’ nests.~=It offers a detail about how female cuckoos carry out the behavior discussed in the text.#Correct. Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first
two sentences establish that birds of some species don’t raise their own young; instead, they lay their eggs in the nests of
birds of other species. The underlined sentence then states that female cuckoo birds engage in this behavior, having been
observed specifically laying their eggs in other nests while the other birds are out finding food. According to the text, the
cuckoo chicks are then raised by the other birds. Thus, the underlined sentence provides a particular detail about how female
cuckoos carry out the behavior of laying eggs for other birds to raise.~It explains how other birds react to the female cuckoo behavior discussed in the text.#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence describes only female cuckoo behavior (laying eggs in
the nests of birds of other species when the other birds are away); it’s the last sentence of the text that addresses the other
birds’ reaction, indicating that those birds usually raise the cuckoo chicks once they’ve hatched.}

Question 11 - d2a90d4f

The majority of plastics today wind up in landfills or are, at best, recycled into materials that have a very limited range of
applications. To address this problem, chemist Guoliang Liu and colleagues designed a reactor that melts polyethylene and
polypropylene—two widely used plastics—into a wax. The wax can then be transformed into a surfactant (a chemical
compound usable as a detergent). With this promising new method, plastic waste could be turned into a range of useful
cleaning products.
Which choice best states the function of the underlined portion of the text?

{1:MCV:~=It clarifies the meaning of a scientific term.#Correct. Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined phrase functions in the text as a
whole. The text states that the wax produced by Liu and colleagues’ reactor can be turned into a surfactant. The underlined
phrase, which is set off with parentheses, then provides a definition for the term "surfactant," explaining that it’s a chemical
compound that can be used as a detergent. Thus, the underlined portion of the text functions to clarify the meaning of a
scientific term.~It describes an environmental concern.#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. Though the text as a whole focuses broadly on an environmental concern, the underlined phrase does
not; it simply indicates what a surfactant is.~It explains the significance of a scientific discovery.#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. Though the text as a whole focuses on a scientific
discovery (Liu and colleagues’ solution to the problem of plastic recycling), the underlined phrase does not explain its
significance; it simply defines a scientific term used in the discussion.~It identifies a result that confused the team.#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect. Though the text as a whole
includes discussion of the result found by Liu and colleagues, the underlined phrase does not discuss it; it simply defines a
scientific term used in the discussion. Additionally, at no point in the text is it mentioned that the team was confused.}

Question 12 - 809addda

The following text is from Ameen Rihani’s 1921 poem “The Wanderer.” 
I wander among the hills of alien lands
Where Nature her prerogative resigns
To Man; where Comfort in her shack reclines
And all the arts and sciences commands.
But in my soul
The eastern billows roll—
I hear the voices of my native strands.
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined lines in the text as a whole?

{1:MCV:~It establishes that the speaker’s enthusiasm about current travels conflicts with the growing urge to return home.#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. While the text’s first line states that the speaker is traveling and the underlined lines indicate that the
speaker experiences an emotional pull toward home, neither the underlined lines nor the text as a whole establishes an
enthusiasm about the current travels that conflicts with a growing urge to return home. The text’s description of the lands
the speaker is traveling in focuses on their artificial quality, stating, "Nature her prerogative resigns / To Man," which doesn’t
suggest enthusiasm but rather a sense of detachment or even critique.~It illustrates the speaker’s uncertainty about maintaining strong links with relatives in distant places.#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined lines
don’t address uncertainty about maintaining links with relatives in distant places. In the underlined lines, the speaker
expresses a sense of connection to the speaker’s homeland ("native strands") but doesn’t refer to any family members the
speaker may have there or to concerns about maintaining any familial ties.~=It conveys the speaker’s sense of feeling a pull toward home while traveling in an unfamiliar place.#Correct. Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined lines in the text as a whole.
In the opening line of the text, the speaker describes wandering in "alien lands," which establishes that the speaker is
traveling in unfamiliar territory. In the underlined lines, the speaker describes "billows" (large waves) rolling in the soul, which
suggests that the speaker feels inner turmoil. The underlined lines go on to associate these rolling billows with voices calling
to the speaker from the speaker’s "native strands," or homeland, indicating that thoughts of home are prompting the
emotional experience these lines describe. Taken together, the imagery in the underlined lines thus implies that the speaker
feels a deep emotional connection to, or pull toward, home while traveling in an unfamiliar place.~It reveals that upon returning after an extended absence, the speaker longs for the way a location once felt.#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because the poem doesn’t
indicate that the speaker has returned home after an absence. Rather, the speaker explicitly states, "I wander among the hills

of alien lands," establishing that the current setting is a foreign place. Moreover, the underlined lines express a sense of
connection with, or pull toward, a distant homeland, not a sense of longing for how that homeland or any other location once
felt.}

Question 13 - ea971260

The following text is adapted from Louisa May Alcott’s 1869 novel An Old-Fashioned Girl. Polly, a teenager, is visiting her
friend Fanny.
Fanny’s friends did not interest Polly much; she was rather afraid of them [because] they seemed so much older and
wiser than herself, even those younger in years. They talked about things of which she knew nothing and when Fanny
tried to explain, she didn’t find them interesting; indeed, some of them rather shocked and puzzled her.
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

{1:MCV:~=To portray Polly’s reaction to Fanny’s friends#Correct. Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to show how Polly
reacted to some of Fanny’s other friends. The text describes Polly as being frightened of Fanny’s friends because they
seemed “much older and wiser” to her and elaborates that they “talked about things of which” Polly was unfamiliar,
uninterested, and shocked. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to describe Polly’s impressions of Fanny’s other friends.~To identify the topics Polly talks about with Fanny’s friends#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because the text does not provide any of the topics Polly discussed with Fanny’s friends, stating only
that Polly found the topics unfamiliar, uninteresting, and shocking.~To explain how Fanny met some of her friends#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because the text says nothing about
how Fanny and her other friends first met.~To illustrate how Fanny’s friends feel about Polly#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because the focus of the text is on Polly’s feelings about
Fanny’s other friends, not on the other friends’ feelings about Polly.}

Question 14 - ea9dfe27

The following text is from Joan Didion’s memoir The Year of Magical Thinking. In the text, the author discusses her home
life.
[I]n California we heated our houses by building fires. We built fires even on summer evenings, because the fog came in.
Fires said we were home, we had drawn the circle, we were safe through the night.
©2005 by Joan Didion
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?

{1:MCV:~=It illustrates that a fire provides comfort beyond physical warmth.#Correct. Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a
whole. The first two sentences of the text establish that in California, houses were heated by building fires year-round. The
underlined portion then indicates that the fires didn’t merely provide physical warmth: they also represented being "home"
and feeling protected. The underlined portion thus illustrates that a fire provides comfort beyond physical warmth.~It summarizes the information that came before it in the text.#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t summarize information that came before it. Whereas the
previous two sentences describe fires’ ability to provide physical warmth to homes, the underlined portion focuses on the
psychological comfort the fires offered.~It explains that the house remains cold even in summer.#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text’s second sentence mentions that fires were
built in the summer because fog came in, which may have cooled the house, this detail isn’t the focus of the underlined
portion. Instead, the underlined portion indicates that fires were built for reasons beyond physical warmth: to create a sense
of being home and safe.~It suggests that the author feels comfortable in her home with or without a fire.#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion focuses on the emotional significance the
author places on having a fire going inside the home. There is no indication that the author feels equally comfortable without
a fire present.}

Question 15 - c8603ed7

San Francisco is known for the colorful murals painted on many of its buildings. The densest collection of murals is found
on Balmy Alley in the Mission District neighborhood. In the 1970s, Latina artists painted vivid scenes of community life on
walls along this block. As the original murals have faded, later generations of artists have painted new ones over them. As a
result, Balmy Alley has become a living showcase of San Francisco’s artistic spirit, with its murals reflecting changes in the
cultural life of the city.
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

{1:MCV:~To compare the Balmy Alley murals to other murals in San Francisco#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. Although it can be inferred from the text that there are murals in other areas of San Francisco besides
Balmy Alley, the text doesn’t specifically discuss murals in other areas or compare the murals of Balmy Alley to those in other
areas.~=To offer an overview of the history and importance of the Balmy Alley murals#Correct. Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text. The text begins by briefly stating that San
Francisco is known for its murals, then transitions to a discussion of a single collection of murals, which is found on Balmy
Alley in the city’s Mission District. The text explains that the murals in this area were originally created in the 1970s, then
observes that they have changed over time: as some have faded through the decades, others have been painted in their
place. The text ends by emphasizing that these murals are significant because they reflect San Francisco’s artistic spirit and
cultural life. Therefore, the text provides an overview of the history and importance of the Balmy Alley murals.~To urge people to protect the murals of San Francisco from decay#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. By observing that some of the murals of Balmy Alley have been replaced due to fading, the text
implies that murals can decay, but it never urges readers to protect this specific collection of murals—or any murals
elsewhere in San Francisco, for that matter. Indeed, by describing the ever-changing murals of Balmy Alley as “a living
showcase of San Francisco’s artistic spirit,” the text emphasizes the positive aspects of the fact that the original Balmy Alley
murals have faded and been replaced with new murals.~To describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco beginning in the 1970s#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe the rise of
mural painting in San Francisco generally or note when this occurred. The only historical development of the 1970s
mentioned in the text is the origin of the murals in a specific area of the city: Balmy Alley in the Mission District.}

Question 16 - 9c759a09

The following text is from Georgia Douglas Johnson’s 1922 poem “Benediction.”
Go forth, my son,
Winged by my heart’s desire!
Great reaches, yet unknown,
Await
For your possession.
I may not, if I would,
Retrace the way with you,
My pilgrimage is through,
But life is calling you!
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

{1:MCV:~To express hope that a child will have the same accomplishments as his parent did#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because the speaker encourages the child to pursue new experiences (“Great reaches”) without
knowing exactly what those experiences will be (“yet unknown”) or suggesting that they should match the speaker’s own
accomplishments.~To suggest that raising a child involves many struggles#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because the speaker focuses on positive possibilities for her son (“Great reaches,
yet unknown”) and her enthusiastic encouragement to embrace those possibilities (“life is calling you!”), while there is no
mention of raising a child or associated struggles.~To warn a child that he will face many challenges throughout his life#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because the speaker frames the possibilities for her
son in a positive light when she says that “great reaches, yet unknown” are waiting for him, and this positive outlook for the
son is consistent throughout the text.~=To encourage a child to embrace the experiences life will offer#Correct. Choice D is the best answer because it accurately states the text’s main purpose. The poem begins with the speaker urging a
child to “go forth” with her encouragement (“my heart’s desire”). The speaker goes on to suggest that new experiences
(“Great reaches, yet unknown”) lie ahead for the son that “life is calling” him to seek out. Thus, the main purpose is to
encourage a child to embrace the experiences available to him in his life.}

Question 17 - a68239ed

The following text is adapted from Oscar Wilde’s 1897 nonfiction work De Profundis. 
People whose desire is solely for self-realisation never know where they are going. They can’t know. In one sense of the
word it is of course necessary to know oneself: that is the first achievement of knowledge. But to recognise that the
soul of a man is unknowable, is the ultimate achievement of wisdom. The final mystery is oneself. When one has
weighed the sun in the balance, and measured the steps of the moon, and mapped out the seven heavens star by star,
there still remains oneself. Who can calculate the orbit of his own soul?
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined question in the text as a whole?

{1:MCV:~=It reinforces the text’s skepticism about the possibility of truly achieving self-knowledge.#Correct. Choice A is the best answer. The text repeatedly claims that true self-knowledge can’t possibly be achieved, and this
rhetorical question emphasizes that point.~It speculates that some readers will share the doubts expressed in the text about the value of self-knowledge.#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. The underlined question doesn’t do this. The text never expresses doubts about the value of selfknowledge—rather, the text expresses doubts about the possibility of achieving self-knowledge.~It cautions readers that the text’s directions for how to achieve self-knowledge are hard to follow.#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. The
underlined question doesn’t do this. The text doesn’t provide directions for how to achieve self-knowledge—rather, it claims
that true self-knowledge is impossible to achieve.~It concedes that the definition of self-knowledge advanced in the text is unpopular.#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect. The underlined question doesn’t do this. The text
doesn’t ever define self-knowledge, and popularity isn’t mentioned in the text at all.}

Question 18 - e5ca7687

Archaeologists studying the ancient city of Pompeii in Italy recently discovered a well-preserved food shop known as a
thermopolium. The site contains food remains, artworks, and decorations. These items give researchers a better
understanding of what daily life in Pompeii may have been like. For example, the archaeologists found a ceramic jar that they
believe likely contained a meat and seafood stew. 
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

{1:MCV:~To compare ancient artworks with modern ones#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text states that archaeologists found ancient artworks, it doesn’t compare these artworks
to modern ones or to any other artworks.~To discuss the political system of Italy#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. Although the archaeological discovery discussed in the text
was made in Italy, the text doesn’t provide any information about politics or government in Italy.~=To present a recent archaeological discovery#Correct. Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text states that
archaeologists recently discovered a well-preserved food shop, or thermopolium, in Pompeii, Italy. The text then further
describes the contents of the discovery and provides an example of what was found. Thus, the overall purpose of the text is
to present a recent archaeological discovery.~To describe a region’s climate#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect
because the text doesn’t discuss the climate where the archaeological discovery was made or in any other region.}

Question 19 - 97ca2cda

In the early days of television in the 1940s, many people thought that US television programs would rely on the financial
support of ad agencies and commercial sponsors, much like radio did. But advertisers hesitated to jump into a new space,
particularly at a time when the manufacturing of new television sets was stalled due to the US’s involvement in World War II.
Broadcasters, like the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), needed to persuade advertisers to support their programming
despite not knowing whether there would be a robust television audience to begin with.
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined phrase in the text as a whole?

{1:MCV:~It compares the beginnings of radio programming with the beginnings of television programming in the United States.#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. The text merely mentions that television was expected to be financed through advertising, as radio
was at the time. Nothing in the text compares the origins of radio and television.~=It identifies a specific reason behind some advertisers’ hesitance to support television.#Correct. Choice B is the best answer because it accurately describes the function of the underlined phrase in the text as a whole.
According to the text, advertisers were reluctant to support television in its early days. The underlined phrase then indicates
that this reluctance was partly due to the US’s involvement in World War II, which hindered television production. Thus, the
underlined phrase identifies a specific reason behind some advertisers’ hesitance to support television.~It describes how broadcasters attempted to convince advertisers to support television.#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. The underlined phrase
focuses on a reason advertisers were reluctant to support television, not measures taken to convince advertisers to support
television.~It explains why a type of television programming was popular at the time.#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect. The underlined phrase focuses on a reason advertisers were reluctant to support television,
not what types of television programming were popular.}

Question 20 - a2dd51c1

In most building demolitions, the building materials are destroyed and sent to landfills. City officials in Portland, Oregon,
wanted to reduce this waste. The officials passed a law requiring demolition companies to deconstruct some buildings
instead. Deconstruction involves carefully taking buildings apart piece by piece. Damage to the materials is avoided so that
they can be reused in new constructions. A 2019 study found that 27 percent of materials from deconstructions in Portland
were able to be reused. The remaining materials were processed for recycling instead of going to a landfill.
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

{1:MCV:~=To explain an effort made by the city of Portland to reduce demolition waste and some results of that effort#Correct. Choice A is the best answer. The author first describes a Portland law aimed at reducing demolition waste, and then goes on
to explain that 27% of materials from building deconstructions were able to be reused and the rest were recycled.~To show that popular support for measures that reduce demolition waste has increased since 2019#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. The text never discusses the popularity of the law.~To argue that building deconstruction is not as effective as other measures at reducing demolition waste#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. The text never compares
building deconstruction to other measures designed to reduce demolition waste.~To discuss laws aimed to reduce demolition waste in Portland and compare them to similar laws in other cities#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect. The text never
mentions laws in cities other than Portland, Oregon.}

Question 21 - 48e4021d

The following text is from Holly Goldberg Sloan’s 2017 novel Short. 
More than two years ago my parents bought a piano from some people who were moving to Utah. Mom and Dad gave it
to my brothers and me for Christmas. I had to act really happy because it was such a big present, but I pretty much
hated the thing from the second it was carried into the hallway upstairs, which is right next to my bedroom. The piano
glared at me. It was like a songbird in a cage. It wanted to be set free.  
©2017 by Holly Goldberg Sloan
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

{1:MCV:~It explains why the narrator always wanted a piano close to her bedroom.#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the narrator hated having the piano upstairs right next to her bedroom,
not that she wanted a piano to be close to her bedroom.~=It establishes how the narrator feels about the piano.#Correct. Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text, which is to establish the narrator’s feelings
about the piano. The narrator reveals that she “had to act really happy” about the piano even though she “pretty much hated
the thing” as soon as it was placed upstairs near her bedroom. The narrator also describes the piano as glaring at her and
compares it to a caged bird that wants to be set free. These details establish the narrator’s feelings about the piano,
suggesting that it makes her uneasy.~It suggests that the narrator’s brothers are talented piano players.#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because the only information provided in the
text about the narrator’s brothers is that they were given the piano along with the narrator.~It describes the event that led the narrator’s parents to buy a piano.#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because the
text does not describe the event that led the narrator’s parents to buy the piano from the people moving to Utah. Instead, the
text focuses on the narrator’s feelings about the piano after it was given to her and her brothers.}

Question 22 - 7d075fc5

Oral histories—whether they consist of interviews or recordings of songs and stories—can offer researchers a rich view of
people’s everyday experiences. For her book about coal mining communities in Kentucky during the twentieth century, Karida
Brown therefore relied in part on interviews with coal miners and their families. By doing so, she gained valuable insights into
her subjects’ day-to-day lives.
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?

{1:MCV:~It provides a little-known geographical fact about Kentucky.#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because though the text mentions coal miners who live in Kentucky, the underlined sentence does not
offer a geographical fact about Kentucky.~It argues that Karida Brown is an expert on United States politics.#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence does not mention United
States politics or that Brown is an expert in this particular area.~It presents a major historical event that took place in the twentieth century.#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text mentions that
Brown’s book revolved around coal miners during the twentieth century, the underlined sentence does not focus on a major
historical event during this time.~=It describes how Karida Brown benefited from incorporating oral history in her book.#Correct. Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a
whole. The text begins by pointing out one of the advantages of oral histories: that they allow researchers to document the
daily experiences of people. The text then goes on to describe how Karida Brown utilized interviews with coal miners and
their families for her book about twentieth-century coal mining in Kentucky. The underlined sentence affirms that the general
advantages of oral histories mentioned earlier in the text were also benefits in Brown’s particular case. Thus, the underlined
sentence describes how Karida Brown benefited from incorporating oral history in her book.}

Question 23 - 1b5d4e3e

Were penguins always flightless? Theresa Cole and her team argue that penguins could fly at some point, but that they lost
that ability more than 60 million years ago as they adapted to marine life. After examining various penguin fossils and
genetic information, the researchers concluded that over time penguins developed underwater vision, blood oxygenation,
and bone density better suited for swimming than flying. Thus, environmental conditions might have driven penguins to
change from flyers to swimmers.
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?

{1:MCV:~It defines a scientific term used in the sentence that follows.#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because none of the terms used in the sentence that follows are defined in the underlined sentence; no
definitions are given at all. Instead, the sentence presents Theresa Cole and her team’s answer to the earlier question about
penguins’ ability to fly.~It contradicts a description in the sentence that follows.#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because there is no contradiction between the underlined sentence and the
sentence that follows since both convey that at some point penguins underwent adaptations that limited their ability to fly
and helped them swim and live in the sea. Instead of contradicting later information, the underlined sentence presents an
answer to the earlier question about penguins’ ability to fly.~=It provides an answer to the question in the previous sentence.#Correct. Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The text
begins with a question: have penguins always been unable to fly? The underlined sentence then presents an answer that has
been offered by researchers, indicating that Theresa Cole and her team believe that penguins were once able to fly but lost
that ability long ago as they began living in the sea. The text then describes the research that led to that answer. Thus, the
function of the underlined sentence is to provide an answer to the question in the previous sentence.~It notes that the question in the previous sentence has not been researched.#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because the question in the previous
sentence is about penguins’ ability to fly and the underlined sentence presents Theresa Cole and her team’s answer to that
question based on their research into penguin flight, which is described in the rest of the text.}

Question 24 - 47904792

Animals use many objects as tools to achieve goals more easily. Such goals include grooming, finding food, and protecting
themselves. For a long time, people thought tool use was unique to primates. Dolphins and other animals, though, have
busted the myth that tool use requires hands. Inventively, dolphins use sponges to protect their noses from scratches when
foraging on the seafloor. Palm cockatoos also get creative. They use leaves to pad their beaks when opening nuts.
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

{1:MCV:~To question the belief that birds are intelligent#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention intelligence at all, focusing just on the idea that animals use tools.
Further, the text mentions one kind of bird (palm cockatoos) only as an example of a non-primate that uses tools and
describes its use of tools as creative, not unintelligent.~To compare tool use in humans with tool use in palm cockatoos#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions tool use in primates
(a group that includes humans) and in palm cockatoos, it doesn’t compare humans’ tool use with palm cockatoos’ tool use.
The text mentions palm cockatoos only as one example out of the variety of animals that use tools and never directly
mentions tool use in humans.~To establish that tool use doesn’t indicate intelligence#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses tool use but never makes any mention of
intelligence. Rather than establishing that tool use doesn’t indicate intelligence, the text describes certain tool use as
inventive and creative.~=To argue that a variety of animals use tools#Correct. Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main purpose of the text. The text first states that animals
make use of objects as tools to help them achieve different goals. The text then explains that although people used to think
only primates use tools, tool use by dolphins (aquatic mammals) and palm cockatoos (birds) has shown that primates are
not the only animals that use tools. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to argue that a variety of animals, not just primates,
use tools.}

Question 25 - e5da61f1

The following text is adapted from Charles Chesnutt’s 1899 short story “Mars Jeems’s Nightmare.” The narrator and his wife
have recently moved to the southern United States, and Julius is their carriage driver.
Julius [was] very useful when we moved to our new residence. He had a thorough knowledge of the neighborhood, was
familiar with the roads and the watercourses, knew the qualities of the various soils and what they would produce, and
where the best hunting and fishing were to be had. He was a marvelous hand in the management of horses and dogs.
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

{1:MCV:~To compare the narrator’s reaction to a new home with his wife’s reaction#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t portray either the narrator’s or his wife’s reaction to their new home. Rather,
the text focuses on how Julius was useful to the narrator and his wife in their new home.~To give an example of Julius’s knowledge about soil#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. Although the
text states that Julius was knowledgeable about the soil, this is one of several supporting details that illustrate how helpful
Julius was. Moreover, the text merely states that Julius was knowledgeable about soil; it doesn’t provide an example of that
knowledge.~To show that the narrator and Julius often hunt and fish together#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest the frequency with which the narrator and
Julius hunted and fished together. In fact, it’s unclear from the text whether the narrator and Julius hunted and fished
together at all. The text merely indicates that Julius knew the best places to hunt and fish—a detail that supports the text’s
main purpose by conveying Julius’s usefulness.~=To explain different ways in which Julius was helpful#Correct. Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to explain different
ways in which Julius was helpful. The text begins with the narrator stating that Julius was very helpful to him and his wife
when they moved to their new residence. The narrator then provides a list of examples to illustrate Julius’s helpfulness. For
instance, the narrator states that Julius was familiar with the neighborhood’s roads, which suggests that he was helpful in
navigating them, and that Julius helped manage the horses and dogs. The text’s many examples of Julius’s usefulness
reinforce just how helpful he was and in how many different ways.}

Question 26 - ac5bf490

The following text is from Reyna Grande’s 2012 memoir The Distance Between Us. In the text, Grande reflects on a time
when she and her older sister Mago were children. A Barbie is a type of doll.
I begged Mago to come play with me. She wasn’t as interested in my Barbie as she had been just two months before,
which made me sad because that was the only thing Mago had envied me for. Usually, it was me doing the envying.
After I pestered her relentlessly, she finally put her notebook down and came over to me.
©2012 by Reyna Grande
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text?

{1:MCV:~=It indicates Grande’s unhappiness over Mago’s disinterest in Grande’s doll.#Correct. Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined portion in the text. The
underlined portion ("which made me sad because that was the only thing Mago had envied me for") directly expresses
Grande’s unhappiness about her sister’s diminished interest in her Barbie doll. The underlined text specifically identifies that
Grande feels sad and explains why Mago’s disinterest particularly affects her—because it was the one rare instance where
her older sister had envied her, rather than the reverse.~It expresses Grande’s anger over Mago’s refusal to spend time with her.#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined portion expresses sadness, not anger. Although there is some correspondence
between the emotions anger and envy and the text does indicate that Grande usually envies her sister, the underlined portion
states that Grande feels sad about Mago’s disinterest in Grande’s Barbie, not angry about Mago’s refusal to spend time with
her.~It presents an example of how Mago and Grande generally played together as children.#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. While the first part of the sentence that contains the underlined portion indicates that Mago has
previously taken an interest in Grande’s Barbie, implying that the sisters may regularly have played with the Barbie together in
the past, the underlined portion doesn’t provide an example of this. The underlined portion instead explains why Mago’s
recently developed disinterest in the Barbie saddens Grande.~It provides a reason for why Mago is unwilling to play with Grande.#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because neither the underlined portion
nor the text as a whole explains why Mago is unwilling to play with Grande. Rather than addressing Mago’s motivation or
reasoning, the underlined portion describes Grande’s emotional reaction to Mago’s disinterest in Grande’s Barbie and
explains why this lack of interest matters to Grande.}

Question 27 - b3e145e4

In the 1950s, scientists didn’t know much about the ocean floor. Many scientists at the time believed that the ocean floor
was mostly flat. But geologist Marie Tharp and her research partner, Bruce Heezen, proved that this idea was wrong. Using
sonar data collected from the Atlantic Ocean, Tharp and Heezen showed that the floor was filled with canyons, mountains,
and valleys.
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?

{1:MCV:~=It identifies a scientific belief that Tharp and Heezen showed to be wrong.#Correct. Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a
whole. The first sentence of the text establishes that scientists didn’t know much about the ocean floor in the 1950s. The
second sentence, which is underlined, describes what many scientists thought at the time—that the ocean floor was mostly
flat. The remainder of the text establishes that the ocean floor is far from flat, citing research conducted by Marie Tharp and
Bruce Heezen. Thus, the purpose of the underlined sentence is to identify a scientific belief that Tharp and Heezen showed
to be wrong.~It describes the design of Tharp and Heezen’s experiment.#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. Although Tharp and Heezen’s work with sonar data in the Atlantic Ocean is mentioned later in the text,
the underlined sentence doesn’t describe the design of their experiment. Instead, it identifies a belief held by scientists that
Tharp and Heezen demonstrated to be wrong.~It emphasizes a disagreement between Tharp and Heezen.#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence presents a belief held
by many scientists in the 1950s; nowhere does the text mention a disagreement between Tharp and Heezen, whom the text
describes as research partners working together to map the ocean floor.~It presents data to support a claim that Tharp and Heezen made.#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined
sentence doesn’t present data in support of a claim; instead, it presents a scientific belief that Tharp and Heezen’s work
showed to be wrong.}

Question 28 - 0ed94d4c

Jackie Ormes’s Torchy Brown in Dixie to Harlem (1937–38) was the first comic strip by a Black woman to appear in a widely
read newspaper. The strip tells the story of Torchy, a young woman who leaves Mississippi to become a performer in New
York City. Torchy’s story reflects the experience of the Great Migration (1910–1970), when millions of Black Americans left
the South in search of opportunities in other parts of the United States. Torchy Brown thus shows how Ormes used comics
to comment humorously on issues affecting Black Americans, which she continued to do throughout her career.
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

{1:MCV:~To show how Ormes’s Torchy Brown inspired other Black women to write comic strips in the 1930s#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. The text never mentions other Black women comic strip writers.~To illustrate how the subjects Ormes addressed in her comic strips changed over the course of her career#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. The text never
mentions any changes in the subjects Ormes addressed.~=To give an example of how Ormes presented the experiences of Black Americans in her comic strips#Correct. Choice C is the best answer. The text describes how Torchy Brown depicted the experiences of a young Black woman
experiencing America’s Great Migration. It further states that Ormes continued to use comics throughout her career to
humorously comment on important issues impacting Black Americans.~To claim that several characters in Torchy Brown were based on people that Ormes knew personally#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect. The text never mentions the inspiration for
characters in Torchy Brown.}

Question 29 - 1d9a09c0

The following text is adapted from Jason Reynolds’s 2016 novel Ghost. The narrator, who is in middle school, is at a bus
stop.
I just go there [to the bus stop] to look at the people working out. See, the gym across the street has this big window—
like the whole wall is a window—and they have those machines that make you feel like you walking up steps and so
everybody just be facing the bus stop, looking all crazy like they’re about to pass out. And trust me, there ain’t nothing
funnier than that. So I check that out for a little while like it’s some kind of movie: The About to Pass Out Show, starring
stair-stepper person one through ten.
©2016 by Jason Reynolds
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

{1:MCV:~To give a reason why the narrator is excited to start middle school#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because the text isn’t about the narrator beginning middle school. The text describes how the narrator
finds people working out at a gym amusing and makes no mention of school life.~=To describe an activity that the narrator finds amusing#Correct. Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text describes how the
narrator watches people working out at a gym through a window near a bus stop. The narrator says that "there ain’t nothing
funnier" than watching people try to work out on the stair climber machine. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to describe
an activity that the narrator finds amusing.~To explain a problem that the narrator has overcome#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because the text
doesn’t mention any problems that the narrator currently has or has overcome. It just describes how the narrator finds
watching people work out amusing.~To discuss a movie that the narrator saw in a theater#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because the narrator invents the made-up movie mentioned in the
text. The text doesn’t indicate that the narrator has seen a movie in a theater. The focus of the text is on the narrator
watching people at the gym, not watching a movie.}

Question 30 - fcc328c6

Streams and rivers carry soil and rocks from one location to another. But there is another way for these geological materials
to move. Scientists call this process “aeolian transport.” In aeolian transport, winds move small particles of soil or rock over
potentially great distances. Geologist Melisa Diaz and her team studied dust in Antarctica to find out if it was moved by
aeolian transport. They discovered that the dust matched geological material in Australia. Aeolian transport had carried it
from one continent to another, across thousands of miles of open ocean. 
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?

{1:MCV:~It presents Melisa Diaz’s remarks about difficulties that her team encountered.#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined portion of the text doesn’t present any remarks from Melisa Diaz, nor does it
suggest that Diaz and her team encountered difficulties in their study. Instead, the phrase in quotation marks in the
underlined portion simply presents a term that is used by scientists to refer to a specific process discussed in the
text.~=It introduces a scientific term that is used in the discussion that follows.#Correct. Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a
whole. The first two sentences introduce the idea that soil and rocks can be moved from one location to another by
something other than rivers and streams. The underlined sentence then states that the term used by scientists to refer to
this process is “aeolian transport.” The discussion that follows explains what aeolian transport is (the movement of small
geological materials over potentially great distances by the wind) and describes an example of a study that found that dust
particles had been moved by aeolian transport from Australia to Antarctica. Thus, the underlined portion introduces a
scientific term that is used in the discussion that follows.~It emphasizes the surprising nature of the findings that are presented.#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in either the underlined portion or the text as a whole suggests that the findings
of the study presented in the text were surprising or unexpected. In fact, the text suggests that Diaz and her team wanted to
see if aeolian transport could explain the appearance of certain geological materials in Antarctica, and their findings did
indeed confirm the involvement of aeolian transport.~It explains the difference between two kinds of geological material.#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect. Although the first sentence of the text mentions
soil and rocks, which are two different kinds of geological material, the underlined portion doesn’t refer to these materials,
nor does it explain the difference between them. Rather, the underlined portion introduces the scientific term “aeolian
transport,” which is used in the discussion that follows.}

Question 31 - 5e732e67

Many films from the early 1900s have been lost. These losses include several films by the first wave of Black women
filmmakers. We know about these lost movies only from small pieces of evidence. For example, an advertisement for Jennie
Louise Touissant Welcome’s documentary Doing Their Bit still exists. There’s a reference in a magazine to Tressie Souders’s
film A Woman’s Error. And Maria P. Williams’s The Flames of Wrath is mentioned in a letter and a newspaper article, and one
image from the movie was discovered in the 1990s.
Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?

{1:MCV:~The text identifies a complex problem, then presents examples of unsuccessful attempts to solve that problem.#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. The fact that we only know about these lost early films from small
pieces of evidence isn’t presented as a “complex problem”—that’s too extreme. And the examples presented are not
“unsuccessful attempts” to solve it. If anything, the examples represent a success, because we discovered that these films
existed in the first place.~The text summarizes a debate among researchers, then gives reasons for supporting one side in that debate.#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. There’s no “debate” presented in the text, so
there’s no “side” for the text to support.~=The text describes a general situation, then illustrates that situation with specific examples.#Correct. Choice C is the best answer. The first three sentences describe the general situation: these early films have been lost, and we
only know about them from small pieces of evidence. The rest of the text offers specific examples of the small pieces of
evidence.~The text discusses several notable individuals, then explains commonly overlooked differences between those#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. The text doesn’t discuss any
“differences” between the filmmakers.}

Question 32 - 56ec23a0

Hiroshi Senju is known worldwide for his paintings of waterfalls. These paintings are large and tend not to show the entire
waterfall.  Instead, Senju focuses on just the point where the falling water reaches the pool below, keeping the top of the
waterfall out of view. While Senju’s paintings are rooted in art movements originating in the United States, the artist uses
traditional Japanese techniques and materials that make his work instantly recognizable.
Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?

{1:MCV:~=It introduces an artist and then explains some common characteristics of well-known paintings by that artist.#Correct. Choice A is the best answer. The first sentence introduces Senju as a famous artist, while the next three sentences describe
the defining features of his art, such as it only showing part of the waterfall and its origins in US art movements and
Japanese techniques.~It explains a specific painting technique and then provides examples of artists who use the technique.#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. The text doesn’t provide examples of any other artists who use Senju’s techniques. Choice C is
incorrect. The text doesn’t describe any single famous painting or make comparisons between paintings. Choice D is
incorrect. The text doesn’t provide an opinion on Senju (just facts), nor does it suggest that his art has been overlooked—in
fact, it states that he is “known worldwide.”~It describes a famous painting and then compares it to a lesser-known painting from the same time period.#No explanation provided.~It gives an opinion on an artist and then suggests multiple reasons why the artist’s work has been largely overlooked.#No explanation provided.}

Question 33 - be947479

Jazz tap is a dance form that was first developed in African American communities. Jazz tap was heavily influenced by jazz
music, which became widely popular in the United States in the 1920s. Tap dancers were inspired by jazz music’s quick
rhythms and by the way jazz musicians would make up melodies as they played. As jazz music continued to develop in the
1930s and 1940s, jazz tap evolved with it. Because of jazz music’s influence, jazz tap quickly developed into a dance form
that was very different from earlier kinds of tap dance.
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

{1:MCV:~It explains why audiences prefer some kinds of music over others.#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that jazz music became widely popular in the US in the 1920s and
describes some of jazz music’s qualities, the text never explains why audiences prefer some kinds of music—jazz or
otherwise—over others.~=It discusses the development of a dance form.#Correct. Choice B is the best answer because it best describes the main purpose of the text. The text indicates where and when jazz
tap first developed (in African American communities in the 1920s) and what influenced it (the quick rhythms and
improvisations in jazz music) and then explains that it evolved alongside jazz music in the 1930s and 1940s, resulting in a
very different form of tap dance than had existed before. Therefore, the main purpose of the text is to discuss jazz tap’s
development.~It describes how to play a musical instrument.#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because the text never mentions any musical instruments and doesn’t describe
how to play one.~It emphasizes the popularity of a famous dancer.#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because the text discusses jazz tap generally and never identifies a particular dancer,
famous or otherwise.}

Question 34 - 1c6b1fa0

In 1801, a Blackfoot chief named Ac Ko Mok Ki drew a finely detailed map of the Upper Missouri region. This work
demonstrates a vast amount of topographic knowledge, as the map features specific names of mountains and rivers, as well
as the first-known sketch of the drainage network of the Missouri River. The map is especially notable because Ac Ko Mok Ki
also included details about the numerous tribes that lived in the area.
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?

{1:MCV:~It emphasizes Ac Ko Mok Ki’s desire to represent other tribes on the map.#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. Though the sentence after the underlined sentence in the text mentions that Ac Ko Mok Ki included
information about other tribes on his map, the underlined sentence itself does not address this topic.~It explains how Ac Ko Mok Ki developed an interest in mapmaking.#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect
because nothing in the underlined sentence indicates how Ac Ko Mok Ki became interested in mapmaking, only that his
mapmaking skills are impressive.~=It identifies some reasons why the map is impressive.#Correct. Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The text
presents information about a map drawn by Blackfoot chief Ac Ko Mok Ki in 1801. The underlined sentence states that the
map "demonstrates a vast amount of topographic knowledge" and mentions that it features the "specific names of
mountains and rivers" and includes the first-known sketch of the Missouri River’s drainage network. These are all
characteristics that indicate that the map was executed with remarkable skill. Thus, the underlined sentence identifies some
reasons why the map is impressive.~It details how the map was used for hunting and trading purposes.#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because though the underlined sentence describes several features
of the map, it does not specifically describe how the map was used.}

Question 35 - 1782cdd7

In many agricultural environments, the banks of streams are kept forested to protect water quality, but it’s been unclear what
effects these forests may have on stream biodiversity. To investigate the issue, biologist Xingli Giam and colleagues studied
an Indonesian oil palm plantation, comparing the species richness of forested streams with that of nonforested streams.
Giam and colleagues found that species richness was significantly higher in forested streams, a finding the researchers
attribute to the role leaf litter plays in sheltering fish from predators and providing food resources.
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

{1:MCV:~It discusses research intended to settle a debate about how agricultural yields can be increased without negative effects#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t the main purpose of the text. The text never mentions agricultural yields. Choice B is
incorrect. This isn’t the main purpose of the text. The text never mentions other kinds of agricultural environments. Choice C
is incorrect. This isn’t the main purpose of the text. The text never mentions any previously held view about how fish in these
streams try to avoid predators.~It explains the differences between stream-protection strategies used in oil palm plantations and stream-protection#No explanation provided.~It describes findings that challenge a previously held view about how fish that inhabit streams in agricultural#No explanation provided.~=It presents a study that addresses an unresolved question about the presence of forests along streams in agricultural#Correct. Choice D is the best answer. The author first describes an unresolved question: what effect do bank forests have on stream
biodiversity? Then the author presents a study that answers the question: bank forests increase stream biodiversity.}

Question 36 - 02e49a0c

Genetic studies have led researchers to suggest that turtles are most closely related to the group that includes modern
crocodiles. But studies of fossils have suggested instead that turtles are most closely related to other groups, such as the
one that contains modern snakes. However, many of the fossil studies have relied on incomplete data sets. For a 2022
investigation, biologist Tiago R. Simões and colleagues examined more than 1,000 reptile fossils collected worldwide. From
this large data set, they found clear agreement with the results of the genetic studies.
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence?

{1:MCV:~It offers an overview of the tools scientists use to examine fossils.#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence mentions the incompleteness of the data sets studied, it doesn’t mention any tools
or techniques used to examine fossils.~=It describes a limitation of some studies about the origin of turtles.#Correct. Choice B is the best answer. The sentence mentions that some fossil studies have relied on incomplete data sets,
suggesting that these studies are limited in what they can tell us about turtles’ origins.~It summarizes previous research on the evolution of crocodiles.#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence doesn’t mention anything about the evolution of
crocodiles.~It criticizes a widely held belief about genetic studies of reptiles.#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect. This sentence doesn’t directly mention or criticize any "widely held belief," and it focuses on
a limitation of fossil studies of reptiles, not genetic studies.}

Question 37 - 662892ad

Wakako Yamauchi is best known for And the Soul Shall Dance, her 1977 play about a Japanese American family in Southern
California. The play is based on a short story Yamauchi had published three years earlier. Adapting the story wasn’t easy.
Theater relies on dialogue between characters, but the original story features little dialogue and instead describes its
characters’ silent thoughts. To transform the story into a play, Yamauchi created situations where characters reveal their
thoughts by speaking them aloud during conversations with each other.
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?

{1:MCV:~=It offers information about how Yamauchi adapted her short story into a play.#Correct. Choice A is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole.
According to the text, it was hard for Yamauchi to adapt her short story into the play And the Soul Shall Dance because the
story had included little dialogue, instead describing the characters’ silent thoughts. The underlined sentence offers
information about how Yamauchi ultimately succeeded in adapting the story into a play: it explains that Yamauchi created
situations where the characters of the play could reveal their internal thoughts while speaking with each other.~It argues that Yamauchi’s play influenced later playwrights.#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because neither the underlined sentence nor the text as a whole makes any mention of playwrights
other than Yamauchi or how the play might have influenced them.~It explains why Yamauchi’s short story is better known than the play adaptation is.#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because the text states that
Yamauchi is best known for her play And the Soul Shall Dance, which conveys that the play is better known than the short
story it’s based on is.~It describes how Yamauchi chose the actors who performed in the play.#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because neither the underlined sentence nor the text as a whole mentions the
actors who performed in the play or Yamauchi’s approach to choosing them.}

Question 38 - d563bf65

The following text is adapted from Jean Webster’s 1912 novel Daddy-Long-Legs. The narrator is a young college student
writing letters detailing her weekly experiences.
[The college is] organizing the Freshman basket-ball team and there’s just a chance that I shall make it. I’m little of
course, but terribly quick and wiry and tough. While the others are hopping about in the air, I can dodge under their feet
and grab the ball. 
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

{1:MCV:~To compare basketball with other sports#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses solely on basketball and doesn’t mention any other kinds of sports. Choice B
is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe aspects of the game of basketball. Instead, it provides the narrator’s reasoning
for thinking that she might make her school basketball team.~To provide details of how to play basketball#No explanation provided.~To state how players will be chosen for the basketball team#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. Although the narrator explains why she
thinks she will be chosen for the basketball team at her school, the text doesn’t go into the general decision-making process
or the requirements for being picked for the team.~=To explain why the narrator thinks she might make the basketball team#Correct. Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. In the first sentence of the
text, the narrator states that she thinks there’s a chance she will become part of the basketball team at her college. She goes
on to explain that she is "quick" and "tough." Based on these characteristics, she thinks she has a chance to join the team.
Thus, the main purpose of the text is to explain why the narrator thinks she might make the basketball team.}

Question 39 - d5600e74

The following text is adapted from Pam Muñoz Ryan’s 2020 novel Mañanaland. In the village where Max lives, there is an old
fortress called La Reina. Children in the village say that the fortress is haunted.
For as long as he could remember, Max had begged Papá [his father] to take him to see La Reina and the ruins up close.
He’d be a hero among his friends if he was the first boy to cross the haunted gates! Just because Papá didn’t believe in
ghosts didn’t mean they weren’t there. Maybe this summer Papá would finally take him. He was almost twelve.
©2020 by Pam Muñoz Ryan
Which choice best describes the overall purpose of the text?

{1:MCV:~To portray how proud Max’s father is of Max#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. The text does not discuss Papa’s feelings toward Max. Rather, it mentions that Max has long wanted
Papa to take him to La Reina and that, unlike Max and some other children, Papa does not believe that La Reina is haunted.~To explain why Max doesn’t want to grow up yet#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. The text mentions that Max is "almost twelve" at the time, which suggests anticipation of growing up
rather than refusal to.~To criticize Max for disliking summer#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. The text indicates that Max hopes to visit La Reina during the current summer,
but nothing suggests that Max dislikes summer.~=To show how much Max wants to visit La Reina#Correct. Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall purpose of the text. The text indicates that "for
as long as he could remember," Max had "begged" his father to take him to La Reina. This point is later emphasized in the
text by indicating that "this summer" his father might "finally take" Max to visit La Reina. Thus, the purpose of the text as a
whole is to show how much Max wants to visit La Reina.}

Question 40 - 764331f8

The following text is from Louise Erdrich’s 1986 novel The Beet Queen. The narrator discusses her relationship with her
young niece, Dot. Celestine, the narrator’s sister-in-law, is Dot’s mother.
Dot was as impatient with babyhood as I. She tried at once to grow out of it. Celestine never saw that, because she, and
only she, took pleasure in Dot’s helpless softness. Only Celestine was saddened by her daughter’s fierce progress. Day
by day, Dot grew stronger. In her shopping-cart stroller she exercised to exhaustion, bouncing for hours to develop her
leg muscles.
©1986 by Louise Erdrich
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?

{1:MCV:~=It offers a detail that shows how Dot is growing stronger.#Correct. Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a
whole. In the text, the narrator makes observations about her young niece, Dot, noting that Dot is making progress toward
outgrowing babyhood and is growing stronger "day by day." The description of Dot purposefully exercising by "bouncing for
hours" reinforces the narrator’s earlier characterization of Dot. The underlined sentence thus offers a detail that shows how
Dot is growing stronger.~It expresses hope that Celestine will mature psychologically.#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. While a sentence earlier in the text mentions Celestine’s psychological state (sadness because Dot is
growing fast), the underlined sentence doesn’t focus on Celestine at all. Instead, the sentence focuses on Dot’s physical
activities to show that she is getting stronger.~It explores some of the narrator’s psychological characteristics.#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence describes Dot’s
behavior, not the narrator’s psychological characteristics. While a sentence earlier in the text establishes that the narrator,
like Dot, was "impatient with babyhood," the underlined sentence specifically addresses Dot’s physical activities in her
stroller.~It indicates how sad Celestine is by describing a behavior she engages in.#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect. While an earlier sentence in the text mentions that Celestine is sad, the underlined sentence
doesn’t focus on how Celestine feels nor does it describe a behavior that Celestine engages in. The sentence focuses
entirely on Dot’s actions, describing her as "bouncing for hours" to show that she is growing stronger.}

Question 41 - 40270820

Catherine L. Cardelús is a researcher who studies canopy soil. Canopy soil is formed in a tree’s branches (its canopy) when
dead leaves and other falling things collect. This material breaks down, becoming canopy soil. Canopy soil helps preserve a
healthy water cycle (how water moves through the environment) in rainforests. This benefit is one reason Cardelús is
interested in the canopy soils in large choibá trees in rainforests in Costa Rica.
Which choice best describes the text’s overall structure?

{1:MCV:~It explains a disagreement between researchers and how it was resolved.#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention any disagreement between researchers, nor does it describe how
such a disagreement was resolved.~It presents an idea and mentions a researcher who disagrees with that idea.#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t present an idea that Cardelús disagrees
with; rather, it describes her research interests and the significance of canopy soil.~It compares the sizes of two types of trees over several years.#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because the text
doesn’t compare the sizes of different types of trees over time. While the text mentions "large choibá trees," it doesn’t
compare them to any other tree type or discuss changes in tree size over several years.~=It introduces a researcher and gives information about what she researches.#Correct. Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by
mentioning Catherine L. Cardelús, "a researcher who studies canopy soil." The text then provides information about her
chosen research topic: the formation of canopy soil in tree branches, the role of canopy soil in preserving a healthy water
cycle in rainforests, and Cardelús’s specific interest in "the canopy soils in large choibá trees in rainforests in Costa Rica."
Thus, the text introduces a researcher and then gives information about what she researches.}
