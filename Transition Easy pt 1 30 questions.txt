After appropriate permissions are granted, a typical archaeological dig begins with a surveyor making a detailed grid of the
excavation site. Then, the site is carefully dug, and any artifacts found are recorded and mapped onto the site grid. ______ the
artifacts are removed, cataloged, and analyzed in a laboratory.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~For instance,#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because "for instance" illogically signals that the actions in this sentence are an example of the actions
in the previous sentence. Instead, the removal, cataloging, and analysis of artifacts are the next and final steps in a process.~On the contrary,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because "on the contrary" illogically signals that the actions in this sentence are directly opposed to the
actions in the previous sentence. Instead, the removal, cataloging, and analysis of artifacts are the next and final steps in a
process.~Earlier,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because "earlier" illogically signals that the actions in this sentence occur before the actions in
the previous sentence. Instead, the removal, cataloging, and analysis of artifacts are the next and final steps in a process.~=Finally,#Correct. Choice D is the best answer. "Finally" logically signals that the actions in this sentence—the removal, cataloging, and analysis
of artifacts—are the next and final steps in a process, following the previous actions of surveying, digging, recording, and
mapping.}

Question 26 - 42870a4e

Marcel Duchamp intended his 1917 so-called ready-made sculpture Fountain to challenge then-prevailing conceptions about

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~Similarly,#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because "similarly" illogically signals that information in this sentence is similar to the claim about the
sculptor’s intention in the previous sentence. Instead, the information about the question raised by the sculpture offers
emphasis in support of that claim.~=Indeed,#Correct. Choice B is the best answer. "Indeed" logically signals that the information in this sentence—that the sculpture raised the
question of whether displaying any object in an art gallery transforms the object into a work of art—offers emphasis in
support of the claim in the previous sentence that the sculpture was intended to challenge conceptions about the nature of
art.~Instead,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because "instead" illogically signals that the information in this
sentence is an alternative to the claim about the sculptor’s intention in the previous sentence. Rather, the information about
the question raised by the sculpture offers emphasis in support of that claim.~In addition,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because "in addition"
illogically signals that the information in this sentence is merely an additional fact related to the claim about the sculptor’s
intention in the previous sentence. Instead, the information about the question raised by the sculpture offers emphasis in
support of that claim.}

On March 3, 1991, Switzerland’s government lowered the minimum voting age for its citizens from 20 to 18 years old. ______
many people in Switzerland gained a new opportunity to participate in their country’s political process. 
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~Nevertheless,#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because "nevertheless" illogically signals that the information that follows is despite the information in
the previous sentence about the Swiss government lowering the voting age. Instead, people gained a new opportunity to
participate in Switzerland’s political process as a result or consequence of that change.~=As a result,#Correct. Choice B is the best answer. "As a result" logically signals that the information in this sentence—that many people in
Switzerland gained a new opportunity to participate in their country’s political process—is a result or consequence of the
previous information about the Swiss government lowering the voting age.~By contrast,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because "by
contrast" illogically signals that the information in this sentence contrasts with the information in the previous sentence
about the Swiss government lowering the voting age. Instead, people gained a new opportunity to participate in
Switzerland’s political process as a result or consequence of that change.~Similarly,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because "similarly" illogically
signals that the information in this sentence is similar to the information about the Swiss government lowering the voting
age in the previous sentence. Instead, people gained a new opportunity to participate in Switzerland’s political process as a
result or consequence of that change.}

Question 28 - c7e85c0a

The envelope-shaped paper bags common in the US 150 years ago were impractical for carrying goods. ______ because they
were the only paper bags that could be mass-produced, these bags dominated the market. That all changed in the 1870s,
when industrial designer Margaret Knight patented a machine to make flat-bottomed, foldable paper bags.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~=However,#Correct. Choice A is the best answer. “However” logically signals that the information in this sentence—that envelope-shaped bags
dominated the market—contrasts with the previous claim that these bags were impractical for carrying goods.~For instance,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because “for instance” illogically signals that the information in this sentence is an example supporting
the previous claim that envelope-shaped bags were impractical for carrying goods. Instead, the sentence contrasts with the
previous claim about the bags.~Thus,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because “thus” illogically signals that the information in this sentence is
a result of the previous claim that envelope-shaped bags were impractical for carrying goods. Instead, the sentence
contrasts with the previous claim about the bags.~In other words,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because “in other words” illogically signals that the
information in this sentence is a paraphrase of the previous claim that envelope-shaped bags were impractical for carrying
goods. Instead, the sentence contrasts with the previous claim about the bags.}

Although novels and poems are considered distinct literary forms, many authors have created hybrid works that incorporate
elements of both. Bernardine Evaristo’s The Emperor’s Babe, ______ is a verse novel, a book-length narrative complete with
characters and a plot but conveyed in short, crisp lines of poetry rather than prose.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~by contrast,#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because “by contrast” illogically signals that the information in this sentence contrasts with the claim
about hybrid works in the previous sentence. Instead, the information demonstrates that Evaristo’s novel is an example of a
hybrid work.~consequently,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because “consequently” illogically signals that the information in this sentence is a
consequence, or result, of the claim about hybrid works in the previous sentence. Instead, the information demonstrates that
Evaristo’s novel is an example of a hybrid work.~secondly,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because “secondly” illogically signals that the
information in this sentence is a second, separate claim from the previous sentence’s claim about hybrid works. Instead, the
information demonstrates that Evaristo’s novel is an example of a hybrid work.~=for example,#Correct. Choice D is the best answer. “For example” logically signals that the information in this sentence—that The Emperor’s Babe is
a novel conveyed in lines of poetry—exemplifies the claim in the previous sentence about hybrid works that incorporate
elements of both novels and poems.}

Question 30 - 7d56630a

In studying whether jellyfish sleep, researchers Michael Abrams, Claire Bedbrook, and Ravi Nath attempted to answer three
questions. ______ is there a period each day when the pulse rates of jellyfish decline? Second, do jellyfish respond more
slowly to stimuli during that period? Finally, if prevented from sleeping, are jellyfish adversely affected?
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~As a result,#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because “as a result” illogically signals that the question in this sentence is a result of the three
questions the researchers attempted to answer. Instead, it is the first of those three questions.~=First,#Correct. Choice B is the best answer. “First” logically signals that the question in this sentence—whether there is a daily period during
which jellyfish pulse rates decline—is the first in a sequence of three questions the researchers attempted to answer about
jellyfish sleep behavior.~Additionally,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because
“additionally” illogically signals that the question in this sentence is an additional question related to the three questions the
researchers attempted to answer. Instead, it is the first of those three questions.~However,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because “however”
illogically signals that the question in this sentence contrasts with the three questions the researchers attempted to answer.
Instead, it is the first of those three questions.}
