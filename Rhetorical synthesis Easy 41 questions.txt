notes to accomplish this goal?

{1:MCV:~A 2017 project by Tania López Marrero and colleagues assigned geographic coordinates to photographs of Puerto Rico’s#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. The sentence describes López Marrero’s team’s 2017 project; it doesn’t provide a definition of the term
"georeferencing." Moreover, it misrepresents the information in the notes by characterizing the team’s assignment of
geographic coordinates to photographs as a process distinct from georeferencing.~Tania López Marrero and colleagues used georeferencing in their analysis of the earliest known aerial photographs of#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence
states that López Marrero’s team used georeferencing, but it doesn’t provide a definition of the term.~Georeferenced aerial photographs from 1930 can help researchers analyze changes in Puerto Rico’s coastline.#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect.

Question 41 - eae29760

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:
The calendar used by most of the world (the Gregorian calendar) has 365 days.
Because 365 days can’t be divided evenly by 7 (the number of days in a week), calendar dates fall on a different day
of the week each year.
The Hanke-Henry permanent calendar, developed as an alternative to the Gregorian calendar, has 364 days.
Because 364 can be divided evenly by 7, calendar dates fall on the same day of the week each year, which supports
more predictable scheduling.
