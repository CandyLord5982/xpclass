Question 1 - a6155e60

Every chemical compound has a spectroscopic fingerprint, a pattern of reflected light unique to that compound. ______ upon
analyzing the light reflected by the bright regions on the surface of the dwarf planet Ceres, Maria Cristina De Sanctis of
Rome’s National Institute of Astrophysics was able to determine that the regions contain large amounts of the compound
sodium carbonate.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~Regardless,#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because “regardless” illogically signals that the action described in this sentence occurs despite the
previous information about spectroscopic fingerprints. Instead, the finding in this sentence is a result or consequence of that
information.~Meanwhile,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because “meanwhile” illogically signals that the action described in this sentence either
occurs at the same time as or offers an alternative to the previous information about spectroscopic fingerprints. Instead, the
finding in this sentence is a result or consequence of that information.~=Thus,#Correct. Choice C is the best answer. “Thus” logically signals that the action described in this sentence—the researcher being able to
determine the chemical makeup of the planet’s bright regions based on how they reflect light—is a result or consequence of
the previous information about spectroscopic fingerprints.~In comparison,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because “in comparison”
illogically signals that the action described in this sentence is being compared with the previous information about
spectroscopic fingerprints. Instead, the finding in this sentence is a result or consequence of that information.}

Question 2 - d10e46a2

The ancient Spartans were known for their bitingly concise—or laconic—wit, a quality they maintained even in the face of
great peril. ______ when Philip II of Macedon threatened Laconia (the region of Greece containing Sparta), he said, “If I invade
Laconia, I shall turn you out.” The Spartans replied with a single word: “If.”
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~Rather,#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because "rather" illogically signals that the exchange between Philip II and the Spartans contrasts with
the previous claim about the Spartans’ wit. Instead, the exchange is an example of their wit.~In other words,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because "in
other words" illogically signals that the exchange between Philip II and the Spartans is a restatement of the previous claim
about the Spartans’ wit. Instead, the exchange is an example of their wit.~That said,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because "that said" illogically
signals that the exchange between Philip II and the Spartans is an exception to the previous claim about the Spartans’ wit.
Instead, the exchange is an example of their wit.~=For instance,#Correct. Choice D is the best answer. "For instance" logically signals that the concise, witty exchange between Philip II and the
Spartans is an example supporting the previous claim—that the Spartans employed wit even in the face of peril.}

Question 3 - 37ec26e7

In order to create the Global Positioning System (GPS), scientists had to develop an accurate mathematical model of Earth’s
shape that accounted for various forces, such as tides. ______ it was mathematician Gladys West who wrote the computer
program that could perform these necessary calculations.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~=Ultimately,#Correct. Choice A is the best answer. "Ultimately" logically signals that West’s completion of the computer program was the
conclusion of the process described in the previous sentence, in which scientists working on GPS sought to develop a
mathematical model of Earth.~In other words,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because "in other words" illogically signals that the information about West’s program is a restatement
of the information about the scientists’ efforts to develop a mathematical model of Earth. Instead, West’s program was the
conclusion of those efforts.~Secondly,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because "secondly" illogically signals that West’s completion of the
computer program was merely the next step in the scientists’ efforts to develop a mathematical model of Earth. Instead,
West’s program was the conclusion of those efforts.~In addition,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because "in addition" illogically signals that West’s
completion of the computer program was merely additional information related to the scientists’ work on GPS. Instead,
West’s program was the conclusion of the scientists’ efforts to develop a mathematical model of Earth.}

Question 4 - 290a5d77

Guard cells are specialized cells that are part of a plant’s pores. These cells help regulate the amount of carbon dioxide a
plant takes in. ______ they help regulate a plant’s water loss.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~=Additionally,#Correct. Choice A is the best answer. "Additionally" logically signals that guard cells’ role in regulating water loss is an additional
function of these specialized plant cells that is separate from the function of regulating carbon dioxide intake.~Previously,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because "previously" illogically signals that the activity described in this sentence occurs earlier in a
chronological sequence of events than the regulation of carbon dioxide intake described in the previous sentence. Instead,
regulating water loss is an additional function of guard cells that is separate from the function of regulating carbon dioxide
intake.~In conclusion,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because "in conclusion" illogically signals that the description of guard cells’ role in regulating
water loss concludes or summarizes the information about guard cells provided in the previous sentences. Instead,
regulating water loss is one of the two distinct functions of guard cells described in the text.~Instead,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because
"instead" illogically signals that the activity described in this sentence happens in place of the activity of regulating carbon
dioxide intake described in the previous sentence. Rather, regulating water loss is an additional function of guard cells.}

Question 5 - d3725911

In the search for extraterrestrial life, astrobiologists Stuart Bartlett and Michael L. Wong propose that scientists avoid using
the term “life.” ______ researchers should use another word: “lyfe.” This new term, they argue, could be used to draw
distinctions between the known characteristics of life on Earth and the potentially differing characteristics of lyfe on other
planets.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~Previously,#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because "previously" illogically signals that the idea in this sentence occurs before the action in the first
sentence. Instead, the use of "lyfe" is an alternative to the previously mentioned use of "life."~Regardless,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because
"regardless" illogically signals that the idea in this sentence is true despite the information in the first sentence. Instead, the
use of "lyfe" is an alternative to the previously mentioned use of "life."~There,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because "there" illogically signals
that the idea in this sentence occurs in a place mentioned in the previous sentence. Instead, the use of "lyfe" is an alternative
to the previously mentioned use of "life."~=Instead,#Correct. Choice D is the best answer. "Instead" logically signals that the idea in this sentence—that researchers should use the word
"lyfe"—is an alternative to the idea mentioned in the previous sentence (scientists’ use of the word "life").}

Question 6 - b7571c0a

Practical movie effects, such as the use of actual locations in a film, provide a more realistic visual experience than
computer-generated imagery (CGI) does, but giving audiences the “real thing” can be prohibitively expensive. ______ many
filmmakers use a blended approach, employing practical effects whenever possible and CGI elements as necessary to
control costs.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~Similarly,#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t a logical transition. The first sentence tells us that practical effects are more realistic but also
more expensive than CGI. The second sentence tells us that many filmmakers use both kinds of effects, balancing realism
with cost. To connect these ideas, we need a cause-and-effect transition, like “therefore.” “Similarly” doesn’t show cause and
effect: it shows the addition of another agreeing idea.~=For this reason,#Correct. Choice B is the best answer. The first sentence tells us that practical effects are more realistic but also more expensive than
CGI. The second sentence tells us that many filmmakers use both kinds of effects, balancing realism with cost. To connect
these ideas, we need a cause-and-effect transition, like “therefore.” “For this reason” has the same meaning as “therefore.” .~Furthermore,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t a logical transition. The first sentence
tells us that practical effects are more realistic but also more expensive than CGI. The second sentence tells us that many
filmmakers use both kinds of effects, balancing realism with cost. To connect these ideas, we need a cause-and-effect
transition, like “therefore.” “Furthermore” doesn’t show cause and effect: it shows the addition of another agreeing
idea.~In other words,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect. This isn’t a logical transition. The first sentence tells us that practical effects are more realistic
but also more expensive than CGI. The second sentence tells us that many filmmakers use both kinds of effects, balancing
realism with cost. To connect these ideas, we need a cause-and-effect transition, like “therefore.” “In other words” doesn’t
show cause and effect: it shows a restatement of the same idea in different words.}

Question 7 - 1ccfcea4

The French directors Colas Koola and Vivien Mermet-Guyenet (known as Koola and Viv) founded the video game studio
BlueTwelve. They also love cats. ______ they created an award-winning cat video game, Stray (2021), that lets the player
explore a dystopian city from the perspective of a clever orange house cat.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~Intermittently,#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because "intermittently" illogically signals that the information in this sentence occurs sporadically or in
intervals. Instead, the creation of the video game offers additional emphasis in support of the previous claim about Koola
and Viv.~On the other hand,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because "on the other hand" illogically signals that the information in this sentence contrasts
with the previous claim about Koola and Viv. Instead, the creation of the video game offers additional emphasis in support of
that claim.~=In fact,#Correct. Choice C is the best answer. "In fact" logically signals that the information in this sentence about the creation of the video
game offers additional emphasis in support of the previous claim that video game studio founders Koola and Viv love cats.~Nevertheless,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because "nevertheless" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is true
despite the previous claim that Koola and Viv love cats. Instead, the creation of the video game offers additional emphasis in
support of that claim.}

Question 8 - a064955f

In most deer species, males grow antlers, and females don’t. ______ reindeer are different. They are the only deer species in
which the females grow antlers, too.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~Similarly,#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because "similarly" illogically signals that the claim in this sentence is similar to the previous
information about most deer species. Instead, it contrasts with that information.~Next,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because "next"
illogically signals that the claim about reindeer in this sentence is the next step in a process. Instead, it contrasts with the
previous information about most deer species.~=However,#Correct. Choice C is the best answer. "However" logically signals that the claim about reindeer in this sentence contrasts with the
information about most deer species in the previous sentence.~Thus,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because "thus" illogically signals that the claim in this
sentence results from the previous information about most deer species. Instead, it contrasts with that information.}

Question 9 - dd087f31

Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s 2013 novel Americanah chronicles the divergent experiences of Ifemelu and Obinze, a young
Nigerian couple, after high school. Ifemelu moves to the United States to attend a prestigious university. ______ Obinze
travels to London, hoping to start a career there. However, frustrated with the lack of opportunities, he soon returns to
Nigeria.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~=Meanwhile,#Correct. Choice A is the best answer. “Meanwhile” logically signals that the action described in this sentence (Obinze’s move to
London to pursue a career) is simultaneous with the action described in the previous sentence (Ifemelu’s move to the United
States). The first sentence establishes that the actions take place around the same time, referring to the characters’
“divergent experiences” following high school.~Nevertheless,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because “nevertheless” illogically signals that the information in this sentence about Obinze’s move to
London is true despite the previous information about Ifemelu’s move to the United States. Instead, as the first sentence
establishes, Obinze’s move and Ifemelu’s move are related, parallel experiences that occur around the same time. Choice C
is incorrect because “secondly” illogically signals that the information in this sentence is a second point or reason separate
from the previous information about Ifemelu’s move to the United States. Instead, as the first sentence establishes, Obinze’s
move and Ifemelu’s move are related, parallel experiences that occur around the same time.~Secondly,#No explanation provided.~In fact,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because
“in fact” illogically signals that the information in this sentence emphasizes, modifies, or contradicts the previous
information about Ifemelu’s move to the United States. Instead, as the first sentence establishes, Obinze’s move and
Ifemelu’s move are related, parallel experiences that occur around the same time.}

Question 10 - e965fd73

Preston Singletary is a Tlingit glass artist who often collaborates with other artists. ______ he has worked with Tewa pottery
artist Jody Naranjo several times. Together, Singletary and Naranjo have created pottery-inspired glass pieces such as
Sunset Stampede and Kiva Steps.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~In conclusion,#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because "in conclusion" illogically signals that the information in this sentence concludes or
summarizes the previous point about Singletary’s collaborations with other artists. Instead, it provides an example in support
of that point.~=For example,#Correct. Choice B is the best answer. "For example" logically signals that this sentence—noting Singletary’s work with Jody Naranjo—
provides an example supporting the previous point about Singletary’s collaborations with other artists.~However,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because "however" illogically signals that the information in this sentence contrasts with
the previous point about Singletary’s collaborations with other artists. Instead, it provides an example in support of that
point.~In comparison,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because "in comparison" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is being
compared to the previous point about Singletary’s collaborations with other artists. Instead, it provides an example in
support of that point.}

Question 11 - 5c58cec0

To guarantee the validity of experimental results, scientists rely on precise, unchanging standards of measurement. ______
metrologists (scientists who study measurement) developed the SI, or International System of Units. The SI’s units of
measurement are based on unchanging values in nature, such as the mass of an electron or the speed of light.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~In contrast,#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because "in contrast" illogically signals that the information that follows contrasts with the previous
claim that scientists rely on precise, unchanging standards of measurement. Instead, the information that metrologists
developed the SI based on unchanging values in nature is a result of that claim.~Regardless,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because "regardless"
illogically signals that the information that follows is true despite the previous claim that scientists rely on precise,
unchanging standards of measure. Instead, the information that metrologists developed the SI based on unchanging values
in nature is a result of that claim.~In addition,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because "in addition" illogically signals that the information that
follows is merely an additional fact related to the previous claim that scientists rely on precise, unchanging standards of
measurement. Instead, the information that metrologists developed the SI based on unchanging values in nature is a result
of that claim.~=For this reason,#Correct. Choice D is the best answer. "For this reason" logically signals that the information that follows—that metrologists developed
the SI based on unchanging values in nature—is a result of the previous claim that scientists rely on precise, unchanging
standards of measurement to guarantee the validity of experimental results.}

Question 12 - 0fd4df40

The Alaska Native Language Archive (ANLA) is known for its impressive audio collection. ______ the ANLA has more than
5,000 audio recordings of Native Alaskan languages dating as far back as 1943.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~=In fact,#Correct. Choice A is the best answer. "In fact" logically signals that the information in this sentence about the large number of
recordings in ANLA’s collection emphasizes and supports the previous claim that ANLA is known for its impressive audio
collection.~After,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because "after" illogically signals that the information in this sentence occurs later in a sequence of
events than the previous claim about ANLA’s impressive audio collection. Instead, the information about the large number of
recordings emphasizes and supports that claim.~Regardless,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because "regardless" illogically signals that the
information in this sentence is true despite the previous claim about ANLA’s impressive audio collection. Instead, the
information about the large number of recordings emphasizes and supports that claim.~Instead,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because
"instead" illogically signals that the information in this sentence presents an alternative to the previous claim about ANLA’s
impressive audio collection. Rather, the information about the large number of recordings emphasizes and supports that
claim.}

Question 13 - 0ee64efc

In the 1850s, William Still was instrumental in helping nearly 1,000 people escape from slavery, earning him the moniker “the
Father of the Underground Railroad.” ______ despite the fame of his contributions during his lifetime, Still is discussed far
less today than other prominent Black abolitionists from his era, such as Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman.   
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~For example,#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that introduces an example. But the second sentence doesn’t provide a
specific example of Still’s famous contributions to the Underground Railroad. Instead, it changes the subject to how his fame
has faded over time.~=However,#Correct. Choice B is the best answer. "However" is used to indicate a contrast between two ideas. The first sentence describes how
Still used to be famous. This sentence describes how Still is not very famous today, so the transition "however" fits perfectly.~Specifically,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that introduces an example or continuation of a
previous idea. But the second sentence doesn’t provide a specific example of Still’s famous contributions to the
Underground Railroad. Instead, it changes the subject to how his fame has faded over time.~Similarly,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect. This
choice uses a transition that indicates the agreement between two ideas. But this sentence shows a contrast with the first
sentence—namely, that Still used to be very famous but now isn’t very famous.}

Question 14 - 56336696

When using sumac for dyeing cloth, textile artists first soak it in water to release its color. Then, they add the cloth to the
dyebath and simmer it for hours, perhaps even days. ______ they will remove the cloth, at which point it will have turned a
vibrant red color.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~Nevertheless,#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because "nevertheless" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is true despite the
previous information about simmering the cloth in the dyebath. Instead, the removal of the cloth is the final step in the
dyeing process.~Likewise,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because "likewise" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is similar to
the previous information about simmering the cloth in the dyebath. Instead, the removal of the cloth is the final step in the
dyeing process.~=Eventually,#Correct. Choice C is the best answer. "Eventually" logically signals that the information in this sentence—that textile artists will
remove the cloth when it has turned red—is the final step in the chronological sequence of the dyeing process described in
the previous sentences.~In other words,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because "in other words" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is a
paraphrase or restatement of the previous information about simmering the cloth in the dyebath. Instead, the removal of the
cloth is the final step in the dyeing process.}

Question 15 - 6036ad0e

In 2014, Nestor Gomez won his first-ever storytelling competition, relating a tale about his life as a Guatemalan immigrant
living in Chicago. ______ in 2017, Gomez created the show 80 Minutes Around the World as a platform for others to share
stories about their immigration experiences.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~Instead,#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because "instead" illogically signals that Gomez created a platform for others to share stories about
their immigration experiences as an alternative to winning his first storytelling competition. Rather, Gomez created the
platform later—in a chronological series of events—than when he won the competition.~For example,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because "for
example" illogically signals that the information about Gomez creating a platform for others to share stories exemplifies his
winning his first storytelling competition. Rather, Gomez created the platform later—in a chronological series of events—than
when he won the competition.~=Later,#Correct. Choice C is the best answer. "Later" logically signals that the information in the sentence—that in 2017 Gomez created a
platform for others to share stories about their immigration experiences—occurs later in a chronological series of events
than the previous information about Gomez winning his first storytelling competition in 2014.~In other words,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because "in other words" illogically signals that the information about
Gomez creating a platform for others to share stories is merely a paraphrase or restatement of the previous information
about Gomez winning his first storytelling competition. Rather, Gomez created the platform later—in a chronological series of
events—than when he won the competition.}

Question 16 - 63c73b50

In 2018, Kurt Luther and Vikram Mohanty created the web-based tool Civil War Photo Sleuth (CWPS). A user uploading an
unknown Civil War soldier’s photograph to CWPS first tags the photo with all known information. ______ CWPS’s facialrecognition software analyzes twenty-seven different physical features and looks for matches to tagged images already in
the database.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~=Then,#Correct. Choice A is the best answer. “Then” indicates that the events in this sentence took place after the events in the previous
sentence. Only after users upload images of unknown soldiers can those images be analyzed.~In fact,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. This transition is used to emphasize the truth of a statement that modifies the previous statement. But
this sentence doesn’t modify the step described in the previous statement: instead, it introduces an entirely new step in the
process. So “in fact” wouldn’t make sense here.~Likewise,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the
addition of a new but related idea, which doesn’t make sense here. Analyzing the physical features in the uploaded
photographs isn’t a similar idea, but rather the next step in the process.~For example,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses an
exemplification transition, which doesn’t make sense here. Analyzing physical features is not an example of uploading and
tagging an image.}

Question 17 - 3831f2d7

Arkansas aviator Louise Thaden was already a record breaker when she won the inaugural National Women’s Air Derby, a
race from California to Ohio, in August of 1929. ______ in December of 1928, Thaden had set an aviation record when she
reached an altitude of 20,269 feet in a Travel Air biplane.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~=Earlier,#Correct. Choice A is the best answer. This choice uses a transition that indicates a shift back in time. Since the first sentence talks
about Thaden’s race win in 1929 and the second shifts back to talking about her record in 1928, this makes the most sense
here.~However,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence actually agrees with and expands on the
previous sentence by describing the earlier record that Thaden had "already" held.~Next,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a
transition that indicates a shift forward in time, which doesn’t make sense here. A record in 1928 didn’t come after Thaden’s
race win in 1929.~As a result,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense in this
context—an event in 1929 can’t cause something in 1928.}

Question 18 - c4f7f726

Many butterfly species have bold, brightly colored wings. ______ some butterfly species have wings that are almost
completely colorless and transparent. Glasswing butterflies, for example, have see-through wings that make them nearly
invisible.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~Similarly,#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because "similarly" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is similar to the previous
information about butterfly species. Instead, it contrasts with the previous information.~Previously,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because
"previously" illogically signals that this sentence describes an event that occurred before another event. Instead, the
sentence provides information about butterfly species that contrasts with the information in the first sentence. Choice C is
incorrect because "in other words" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is a paraphrase or restatement of
the previous information about butterfly species. Instead, it contrasts with the previous information.~In other words,#No explanation provided.~=However,#Correct. Choice D is the best answer. "However" logically signals that the information in this sentence about butterfly species—that
some have colorless, transparent wings—contrasts with the previous information about butterfly species with bold, colorful
wings.}

Question 19 - 2b5e0731

With darkness falling, a mother elephant loses sight of her calf and wants to make sure it is safe. ______ she releases an
infrasonic call for the calf to hear. Infrasonic sound is below the range of human hearing, but many animals can hear these
sounds from several miles away.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~For example,#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that introduces an example of a previous idea. But the second sentence
doesn’t provide an example of the events described in the first sentence. Instead, it describes what happens next: the mother
elephant calls for her calf.~=For this reason,#Correct. Choice B is the best answer. "For this reason" is a cause-and-effect transition. The cause in this case is that the mother
elephant wants to know that her calf is safe, so the effect is that she lets out an infrasonic call for the calf to hear. Therefore,
"for this reason" fits perfectly in this context.~Nowadays,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a shift from the past to the
current time, which doesn’t make sense here. Both sentences use the present tense, as they’re describing the same time
period.~Similarly,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates commonality or agreement between two ideas. But
this sentence isn’t similar to the events in the first sentence. Instead, it describes the events that happen next.}

Question 20 - 1c36e3e1

The number of dark spots that appear on the Sun, known as sunspots, can vary greatly. For example, there were about 180
sunspots in November 2001. ______ there were only about 2 sunspots in December 2008.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~In other words,#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a restatement of the same idea, which doesn’t make sense
here. This sentence doesn’t restate the first example—it describes a totally different example.~Similarly,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. This
choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of a similar idea, which doesn’t make sense here. This sentence
describes a second example that is very different from the first example.~Therefore,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a causeand-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense here. The first example didn’t result in the second example.~=By comparison,#Correct. Choice D is the best answer. The first sentence claims that the number of sunspots can vary greatly. To support this claim,
the next two sentences compare two examples: one time when there were 180 sunspots and one time when there were only
2 sunspots. So the transition “by comparison” fits perfectly.}

Question 21 - ff1a2e5e

Historians agree that the jazz pianist Jelly Roll Morton was exaggerating when he claimed to have invented jazz music. No
one can deny, ______ that Morton’s innovative compositions and remarkable improvisational skills helped shape jazz as a
genre during its early years.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~therefore,#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because "therefore" illogically signals that the claim in the sentence is a result of the previous
information about Morton’s claim to have invented jazz. Instead, the sentence states that Morton helped to shape jazz—even
if his claim was an exaggeration.~in the second place,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because "in the second place" illogically signals that the claim in the
sentence is a second, separate point in addition to Morton’s claim to have invented jazz. Instead, the sentence states that
Morton helped to shape jazz—even if his claim was an exaggeration.~in other words,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because "in other words"
illogically signals that the claim in the sentence is merely a paraphrase or restatement of the previous information about
Morton’s claim to have invented jazz. Instead, the sentence states that Morton helped to shape jazz—even if his claim was
an exaggeration.~=though,#Correct. Choice D is the best answer. "Though" logically signals that the claim in the sentence—that Morton’s improvisational skills
helped shape jazz as a genre during its early years ("No one can deny" it)—is true despite the previous information about
Morton’s exaggerated claim to have invented jazz.}

Question 22 - b5972710

Niger ratified the Outer Space Treaty, an international agreement with over 100 signing nations that acts as the foundation
for the laws of space, on February 1, 1967. Jordan, ______ has yet to officially ratify the treaty; it only signed it.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~=in contrast,#Correct. Choice A is the best answer. "In contrast" logically signals that the information in this sentence—that Jordan has yet to
officially ratify the treaty—contrasts with the previous information about Niger having already ratified the treaty.~specifically,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect because "specifically" illogically signals that the information in this sentence specifies or elaborates on
the previous information about Niger ratifying the treaty. Instead, the sentence changes subjects from Niger to Jordan,
presenting contrasting information about Jordan’s treaty status.~for example,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because "for example" illogically
signals that the information in this sentence exemplifies the previous information about Niger ratifying the treaty. Instead,
the sentence explains that Jordan has yet to ratify the treaty.~similarly,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because "similarly" illogically signals that
the information in this sentence is similar to the previous information about Niger ratifying the treaty. Instead, the sentence
presents contrasting information that Jordan has yet to ratify the treaty.}

Question 23 - 4f2710ab

Organisms have evolved a number of surprising adaptations to ensure their survival in adverse conditions. Tadpole shrimp
(Triops longicaudatus) embryos, ______ can pause development for over ten years during extended periods of drought.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~in contrast,#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because “in contrast” illogically signals that the information in this sentence contrasts with the claim
about organisms in the previous sentence. Instead, it exemplifies this claim.~=for example,#Correct. Choice B is the best answer. “For example” logically signals that the information in this sentence—that tadpole shrimp
embryos can pause development during extended periods of drought—exemplifies the previous sentence’s claim that
organisms have evolved surprising adaptations to survive in adverse conditions.~meanwhile,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect because “meanwhile”
illogically signals that the information in this sentence is separate from (while occurring simultaneously with) the claim
about organisms in the previous sentence. Instead, it exemplifies this claim.~consequently,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because “consequently”
illogically signals that the information in this sentence is a consequence, or result, of the claim about organisms in the
previous sentence. Instead, it exemplifies this claim.}

Question 24 - 34a5ba1c

By 1936, Spanish Romani dancer Carmen Amaya was known all over Spain for her powerful style of flamenco dancing.
However, in July of that year, the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War made it difficult for her to perform in her home country.
______ Amaya left Spain to perform abroad, dancing for audiences across North and South America.

alternate version of Nigeria where breathable air is a rare commodity that is owned and sold by companies. ______ people
must purchase it with currency called O2 credits.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~=As a result,#Correct. Choice A is the best answer. The second sentence describes a consequence of the system laid out in the first sentence:
because air is owned and sold by companies in this world, people have to buy it.~In any case,#Incorrect. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that means “no matter what happens” or “whatever the situation is,”
which doesn’t make sense here. There’s only one situation described in the text: a fictional world in which companies own all
the breathable air, forcing people to buy it.~Nevertheless,#Incorrect. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this
sentence doesn’t disagree with the previous sentence. They both describe the same fictional situation.~Earlier,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect.

conserve energy.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

{1:MCV:~In the first place,#Incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because “in the first place” illogically signals that this sentence is the first point in a discussion.
Instead, the sentence describes a behavior that is a consequence of the previous information about seals.  Choice B is
incorrect because “on the other hand” illogically signals that the behavior described in this sentence contrasts with the
previous information about seals. Instead, it is a consequence of that information.~On the other hand,#No explanation provided.~=For this reason,#Correct. Choice C is the best answer. “For this reason” logically signals that the behavior described in this sentence is a consequence
of the information about seals in the previous sentence. That is, a seal moves its flippers as little as possible during a deep
dive because it needs to keep its heart rate low enough that it does not run out of oxygen.~In comparison,#Incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because “in
comparison” illogically signals that the behavior described in this sentence is being compared to the previous information
about seals. Instead, it is a consequence of that information.}
